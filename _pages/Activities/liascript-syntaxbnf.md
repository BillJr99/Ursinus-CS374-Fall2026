# Syntax and BNF/EBNF

Every programming language has rules about what a program may look like.  Plain English is too vague to state those rules exactly.  BNF (Backus-Naur Form) is the standard notation for writing the rules down precisely, and EBNF (Extended BNF) adds a few shortcuts to it.  A BNF grammar works like a set of recipe templates.  Each template describes the structure of one kind of dish (a statement, an expression, a declaration) without naming the specific ingredients, and a handful of templates can describe endless meals.  The analogy stops there: a grammar is exact where a recipe is loose.  In *Evaluating Languages* you judged languages by criteria.  Today you learn the notation those languages are defined in.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Define the components of a BNF grammar (terminals, nonterminals, productions, start symbol) and identify each in a given grammar
- Construct a derivation sequence for a target string using a provided BNF grammar, applying one rule per step
- Translate EBNF shorthand constructs (repetition `{ }`, optional `[ ]`, grouping `( )`) into their equivalent BNF recursive rules
- Write a BNF or EBNF grammar for a simple programming language construct such as an integer literal, an identifier, or an arithmetic expression
- Explain how EBNF constructs map directly to parser implementation patterns (while loop, if statement) in recursive descent

A language definition cannot afford vagueness, so every modern language publishes its syntax in BNF or EBNF.  Your parser assignment will translate that notation into code, rule by rule.  Today's path runs in four steps: why formal syntax matters, then BNF mechanics, then EBNF conveniences, then grammars for real constructs.

> **Before You Begin:** This activity assumes you can:
> - Read a Python function definition and identify its parts (name, parameters, body)
> - Understand that programming languages have rules about what is valid syntax
> - Know what a recursive definition is
> If any of these feel shaky, review them first.

## Directions and Group Roles

Work in your POGIL team with your rotated roles (**Manager**, **Recorder**, **Presenter**, **Reflector**).  Think each model and question through on your own first, then talk it over with your group.  The Recorder posts your answers to the Class Activity Questions discussion board.  The Presenter reports out wherever you disagreed or found another approach.  After class, respond to the reflective prompt on your own in your notebook.

# Part I: BNF

This part introduces the core BNF notation.  You will practice deriving strings from a grammar by hand.  The goal is to make the rule-by-rule process automatic before we add EBNF's conveniences on top.

## 1.  The Notation

A grammar rule says "this category of thing is built from these smaller pieces."  You start with one big category and keep substituting pieces until only concrete tokens remain.  Here is the idea to carry away: recursion lets a tiny grammar describe an infinite language.

A BNF grammar is a set of rewriting rules.  Each rule is called a *production*, and it has the form

$$
\langle \text{nonterminal} \rangle \rightarrow \text{sequence of terminals and nonterminals}
$$

The pieces have names.  A *terminal* is an actual token of the language, such as `if`, `+`, or an identifier.  A *nonterminal* is a named syntactic category that the rules define; it is written in angle brackets or capitalized.  One nonterminal is the *start symbol*, the category you begin from.  Alternatives within a rule are separated by `|`.  A *derivation* is a sequence of steps that starts at the start symbol and replaces one nonterminal per step using the rules.  A string belongs to the language exactly when some derivation produces it.

Here is a tiny grammar for signed integers:

```
<signed>  -> <sign> <digits> | <digits>
<sign>    -> + | -
<digits>  -> <digit> | <digit> <digits>
<digit>   -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
```

Look at `<digits>`.  Its second alternative uses `<digits>` itself, so the rule is recursive.  That one move is what lets four rules describe infinitely many strings.  Repetition in BNF *is* recursion.

> **Watch out:** beginners often confuse terminals and nonterminals.  Terminals (`0`, `1`, `+`, `-`) are the actual characters that appear in a valid program, and you cannot substitute them further.  Nonterminals (`<digit>`, `<digits>`, `<signed>`) are placeholders that you must eventually replace.  If you apply a rule to a terminal, or forget to replace a nonterminal, your derivation is invalid.

To remember: a production rewrites one nonterminal into terminals and nonterminals.  A derivation applies productions one at a time until only terminals remain.

---

## Model 1: Derive It

In this model you write out a derivation step by step.  A parser performs this same process automatically.  Each step replaces exactly one nonterminal with one of its alternatives.  Work slowly at first.  One rule at a time is what makes a derivation checkable.

Using the grammar above, derive the string `-42`.

### Critical Thinking Questions

1.  Write the derivation step by step, one rule application per line, starting from `<signed>`.  The Recorder writes the team's agreed sequence.
2.  How many derivation steps did `-42` take?  Predict the count for `-12345` and state the general formula in terms of the number of digits.
3.  Show that `4-2` cannot be derived: which rule would have to fire, and why can it not?

### Worked Example: deriving `-42`

Do CTQ 1 as a team first.  Write one rule application per line and name the rule you used on the right.  That habit lets someone else check your derivation.  The example below writes `<number>` for the nonterminal that the grammar above calls `<digits>`; read them as the same rule.

```
<signed>
=> <sign> <number>          (used <signed> -> <sign> <number>)
=> - <number>               (used <sign> -> -)
=> - <digit> <number>       (used <number> -> <digit> <number>)
=> - 4 <number>             (used <digit> -> 4)
=> - 4 <digit>              (used <number> -> <digit>)
=> - 4 2                    (used <digit> -> 2)
= -42
```

Six steps.  For CTQ 2, count them by role: one step for `<signed>` and one for the sign.  Then a $d$-digit number needs $d$ applications of a `<number>` rule and $d$ applications of `<digit>`.  The total is $2 + 2d$ steps.  For `-42` that gives $2 + 4 = 6$, which matches.  For `-12345` it predicts $2 + 10 = 12$.

For CTQ 3: `4-2` cannot be derived.  The only rule that produces a `-` is `<sign> -> -`, and `<sign>` appears exactly once, at the very front of `<signed> -> <sign> <number>`.  No production puts a `-` *between* digits, so no sequence of rule applications can reach `4-2`.  This grammar describes signed numerals, not subtraction.  The string `4-2` belongs to a different language.
4.  Modify the grammar so that a signed number may also be written with no digits after the sign... wait, should it?  Decide as a team whether `-` alone should be a signed integer.  Notice that you are now doing *language design*.

---

## Model 1.5: The Language You Already Know

You have spent three sessions inside a language whose programs are already trees.  Before we go further into notation, write that language down.  **State Scheme's syntax rule precisely enough that a machine could check it.**  Say it in English first, as a team, then put the notation beside it.

```
<expr>  ::= <atom> | <list>
<list>  ::= ( <exprs> )
<exprs> ::= <expr> <exprs> | <empty>
<atom>  ::= <number> | <symbol>
```

**Four productions describe every legal Scheme program ever written.**  That sentence is the reason this model exists; sit with it for a moment before moving on.

Every term from Section 1 has a referent here, so name them against what is on the board.  The **terminals** are `(`, `)`, and the numbers and symbols themselves.  The **nonterminals** are `<expr>`, `<list>`, `<exprs>`, and `<atom>`.  Each line is a **production**, `<expr>` is the **start symbol**, and `<exprs>` mentions itself, which is how BNF says "as many as you like."

### Derivation 1: `(+ 1 (* 2 3))`

Leftmost, one rule per line, exactly as in Model 1:

```
<expr>
=> <list>                              [<expr> ::= <list>]
=> ( <exprs> )                         [<list> ::= ( <exprs> )]
=> ( <expr> <exprs> )                  [<exprs> ::= <expr> <exprs>]
=> ( <atom> <exprs> )                  [<expr> ::= <atom>]
=> ( <symbol> <exprs> )                [<atom> ::= <symbol>]
=> ( + <exprs> )                       [<symbol> => +]
=> ( + <expr> <exprs> )                [<exprs> ::= <expr> <exprs>]
=> ( + <atom> <exprs> )                [<expr> ::= <atom>]
=> ( + <number> <exprs> )              [<atom> ::= <number>]
=> ( + 1 <exprs> )                     [<number> => 1]
=> ( + 1 <expr> <exprs> )              [<exprs> ::= <expr> <exprs>]
=> ( + 1 <expr> )                      [<exprs> ::= <empty>]
=> ( + 1 <list> )                      [<expr> ::= <list>]
=> ( + 1 ( <exprs> ) )                 [<list> ::= ( <exprs> )]
   ... the same six steps again, one level down ...
=> ( + 1 ( * 2 3 ) )
```

**Notice, out loud:** the nesting in the derivation is the nesting in the program.  No step anywhere had to *decide* what binds to what.

### Derivation 2: `3 + 4 * 5`

Now the standard infix arithmetic grammar, which describes the same arithmetic in the notation you learned in school:

```
<expr>   ::= <expr> + <term> | <expr> - <term> | <term>
<term>   ::= <term> * <factor> | <factor>
<factor> ::= ( <expr> ) | <number>
```

```
<expr>
=> <expr> + <term>                     [<expr> ::= <expr> + <term>]
=> <term> + <term>                     [<expr> ::= <term>]
=> <factor> + <term>                   [<term> ::= <factor>]
=> 3 + <term>                          [<factor> ::= <number> => 3]
=> 3 + <term> * <factor>               [<term> ::= <term> * <factor>]
=> 3 + <factor> * <factor>             [<term> ::= <factor>]
=> 3 + 4 * <factor>                    [<factor> ::= <number> => 4]
=> 3 + 4 * 5                           [<factor> ::= <number> => 5]
```

### Critical Thinking Questions

4a.  The Scheme grammar has four productions and no notion of precedence anywhere.  The infix grammar needs three nonterminals, `<expr>`, `<term>`, and `<factor>`, arranged in a hierarchy whose only job is to make multiplication bind tighter than addition.  **What is that extra machinery buying, and what is it costing?**

   > *Hint: it buys the ability to write `3 + 4 * 5` and have it mean what a reader of arithmetic expects.  It costs a grammar that encodes a precedence table in its shape.  In four words: parens are the parse tree.*

4b.  Do not let your team conclude that s-expressions are simply better.  State the strongest case for infix: it reads the way people already read arithmetic, and Lisp's uniformity is paid for by everyone counting closing parentheses.  Which of the readability, writability, and reliability criteria does each side win?  Part 3 of the **BNF Workshop** asks you to take a side, so draft it here.

4c.  Using the four-production Scheme grammar, give a string it cannot generate, and justify it from the rules rather than from intuition.

   > *Hint: `(+ 3 4` with no closing parenthesis.  `<list>` is the only production that introduces `)`, and it introduces exactly one for each `(`.  No sequence of rule applications terminates without it.*

> **Coming attractions, not today's business.**  The infix grammar above is where ambiguity, precedence, and associativity live.  We are only foreshadowing them here.  *Derivations, Parse Trees, Ambiguity, and Precedence* takes them apart properly, and the parser you write in October is what turns this derivation into code.

## 2.  EBNF: Conveniences, Not New Power

EBNF does not make grammars more powerful.  Every EBNF grammar can be rewritten in plain BNF.  What EBNF adds is readability: instead of a recursive rule with two alternatives, you write a loop symbol.  Those symbols also map almost one to one onto the code you will write when you implement a parser.

> **Watch out:** in BNF and EBNF, the `|` symbol means alternation, an "or" between two grammar choices.  It is not the bitwise OR operator from Python or C.  Writing `"+" | "-"` in a grammar means "either a plus sign or a minus sign," not a bitwise operation on two values.

EBNF adds three shortcuts for the recursion patterns BNF repeats everywhere.  Braces `{ }` mean zero or more repetitions.  Brackets `[ ]` mean optional.  Parentheses `( )` group symbols together.  Here is the signed-integer grammar again in EBNF:

```
signed  -> [ sign ] digit { digit }
sign    -> "+" | "-"
digit   -> "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
```

Each shortcut stands for a BNF pattern you could always have written by hand, and it is worth seeing the trade explicitly:

| EBNF | Meaning | What it replaces in BNF |
|---|---|---|
| `{ x }` | zero or more repetitions of `x` | a recursive rule with an empty alternative |
| `[ x ]` | optional, zero or one | two alternatives, one with `x` and one without |
| `( x \| y )` | grouping with alternation | an extra nonterminal holding the alternatives |

Count what just happened to the signed-integer grammar: four rules became three, and the recursive `<digits>` rule disappeared entirely into `{ digit }`.  Here is a second pair, the one you will see most often in language manuals:

```
BNF :  <ident_list> ::= <ident> | <ident> , <ident_list>
EBNF:  <ident_list> ::= <ident> { , <ident> }
```

The two notations describe exactly the same languages.  EBNF is sugar, and the sugar matters to *you* as an implementer.  When we write the parser, `{ digit }` becomes a `while` loop and `[ sign ]` becomes an `if`.  That translation is so mechanical you will do it without thinking by October.

To remember: braces mean repeat, brackets mean optional, and both can be rewritten as recursive BNF rules.  EBNF changes how a grammar reads, not what it can describe.

The EBNF fragment `term { ("*" | "/") term }` describes:

[( )] Exactly one multiplication or division
[( )] An optional single operator between two terms
[(X)] A term followed by zero or more operator-term pairs, such as `a`, `a*b`, or `a*b/c`
[( )] Nested parenthesized expressions

# Part II: Grammars for Real Constructs

You can now read and write basic grammars.  This part applies that skill to constructs from real programming languages.  You will also watch a grammar become runnable Python code, which ties the notation to its implementation.

## Model 2: Read a Real Rule

Reading a grammar for a construct you already know well, such as `if`, is a good check on your understanding of the notation.  As you work through this model, notice how design decisions you take for granted (where braces go, whether `else` is optional) appear precisely in a single line of grammar.

Here is a plausible EBNF rule for a programming language's `if` statement:

```
ifstmt -> "if" "(" expr ")" block [ "else" block ]
block  -> "{" { stmt } "}"
```

### Critical Thinking Questions

5.  List three concrete statements this grammar accepts and two near-misses it rejects.  For each reject, identify the exact point of failure.
6.  Does this grammar accept `if (x) { } else { }` (empty blocks)?  Point to the symbols that decide.
7.  Python uses indentation instead of braces.  Which rule above encodes the brace decision, and what would have to change *outside the grammar* (in the lexer) to support indentation?  (Foreshadowing: lexers can emit invisible tokens.)

---

## Code Cell

```python
# A grammar is data. Here is the signed-integer EBNF as a Python structure,
# and a hand-rolled recognizer that follows it: [sign] digit {digit}.

def recognize_signed(s):
    """Return True if s matches: [ sign ] digit { digit }"""
    try:
        i = 0
        if i < len(s) and s[i] in "+-":   # [ sign ]  -> an if
            i += 1
        if i >= len(s) or not s[i].isdigit():   # digit, required
            return False
        i += 1
        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():    # { digit } -> a while
            i += 1
        return i == len(s)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[syntaxbnf:recognize_signed] {e}")
        import traceback; traceback.print_exc()
        return False

for test in ["42", "-42", "+7", "4-2", "-", "", "007"]:
    print(f"{test!r:8} -> {recognize_signed(test)}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

---

### Reading the Code

- The code follows the EBNF `[sign] digit {digit}` almost symbol for symbol.  The optional `[...]` becomes an `if`, and the repetition `{...}` becomes a `while`.  That correspondence is the point of the notation, and recursive descent three weeks from now rests on it.
- The Try It Yourself recognizer below returns a *position*, not a boolean.  Every rule consumes some prefix of the input and reports where it stopped.  That is how rules compose: the caller carries on from where the callee left off.
- Nothing here builds a tree.  A recognizer answers only "is this legal?"  A parser also answers "what is its structure?", which is the next step up.

### Try It Yourself

Apply the EBNF-to-code recipe to a rule you write yourself.

```python
DIGITS = "0123456789"

def recognize_integer(text, pos=0):
    """EBNF:  integer = [ "-" | "+" ] , digit , { digit }"""
    if pos < len(text) and text[pos] in "+-":
        pos += 1                          # [ ... ] becomes an if
    if pos >= len(text) or text[pos] not in DIGITS:
        return None                       # a required piece is missing
    pos += 1
    while pos < len(text) and text[pos] in DIGITS:
        pos += 1                          # { ... } becomes a while
    return pos

def check(rule, text):
    end = rule(text)
    ok = end == len(text)
    print(f"  {text!r:12} -> {'accept' if ok else 'reject'}"
          f"{'' if ok else f'  (stopped at {end})'}")

print("=== integer = [ sign ] digit { digit } ===")
for t in ["42", "-7", "+0", "", "-", "4a", "007"]:
    check(recognize_integer, t)

print("\n=== YOUR rule ===")
# TODO 1: write the EBNF for an identifier, then transcribe it below:
#           identifier = letter , { letter | digit | "_" }
LETTERS = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

def recognize_identifier(text, pos=0):
    # TODO: the required first letter, then the repetition
    return None

for t in ["x", "count1", "_hidden", "2fast", "a_b_c", ""]:
    check(recognize_identifier, t)

# TODO 2: `007` is accepted by recognize_integer. Is that a bug, a feature,
#         or a question for the language designer? Amend the EBNF to forbid
#         leading zeros (except for "0" itself) and transcribe the change.
#         Note how much more complicated the RULE got, not the code.
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output: the integer rule accepts `42`, `-7`, `+0` and `007`, and rejects the rest.  Your identifier rule should accept everything except `2fast` and the empty string.

## Model 3: The Translation Pattern

The code cell above shows the EBNF-to-code mapping at work.  `[ sign ]` became an `if` statement, and `{ digit }` became a `while` loop.  This is not a coincidence.  It is the translation rule you will apply throughout the parser project: every optional construct becomes a conditional, and every repeated construct becomes a loop.

### Critical Thinking Questions

8.  Match each EBNF construct to its code shape in the recognizer: `[ ... ]` became which statement, and `{ ... }` became which?  This mapping is the whole idea behind recursive descent parsing, six weeks early.
9. `007` is accepted.  Is that a grammar bug, a feature, or a question for the language designer?  Amend the EBNF to forbid leading zeros (except for `0` itself), then explain what the amendment costs in rule complexity.

## Model 4: A Grammar as Data, and the Question It Lets You Ask

Once a grammar is a Python dictionary rather than a comment, you can ask questions about it mechanically.  The first question decides whether the parser you are about to write will work at all: is any rule left-recursive?

A nonterminal $A$ is *directly left-recursive* if it has a production $A \rightarrow A\,\alpha$.  Written as recursive descent, `parse_A` would call `parse_A` as its very first action.  It would have consumed no input, so it would recurse forever.  The standard textbook grammar for arithmetic is left-recursive, and that is exactly the trap.

```python
# A grammar is a dict: nonterminal -> list of productions.
# Each production is a list of symbols. [] is epsilon.

def find_left_recursive(grammar):
    """Nonterminals whose production can start with themselves."""
    return {head
            for head, prods in grammar.items()
            for rhs in prods
            if rhs and rhs[0] == head}

def report(name, grammar):
    lr = sorted(find_left_recursive(grammar))
    verdict = f"LEFT-RECURSIVE: {lr}" if lr else "no direct left recursion"
    print(f"  {name:34} {verdict}")

# The standard textbook form. Correct, and unusable for recursive descent.
grammar_lr = {
    "E": [["E", "+", "T"], ["T"]],
    "T": [["T", "*", "F"], ["F"]],
    "F": [["num"]],
}

# The right-recursive rewrite. SAME language, parseable top-down.
grammar_rr = {
    "E":  [["T", "E'"]],
    "E'": [["+", "T", "E'"], []],
    "T":  [["F", "T'"]],
    "T'": [["*", "F", "T'"], []],
    "F":  [["num"]],
}

grammar_bp = {"S": [["(", "S", "S", ")"], []]}

print("=== Which of these can a recursive-descent parser handle? ===")
report("Left-recursive arithmetic", grammar_lr)
report("Right-recursive arithmetic", grammar_rr)
report("Balanced parentheses", grammar_bp)

print("\n=== The two arithmetic grammars generate the SAME strings ===")
print("  left-recursive  E -> E + T | T      generates T, T+T, T+T+T, ...")
print("  right-recursive E -> T E'           generates T, T+T, T+T+T, ...")
print("  with E' -> + T E' | epsilon")
print("  Same language. Different tree shape, and different parser fate.")

print("\n=== Watch the trap, without actually hanging ===")
depth = 0
def parse_E_naive(tokens, pos):
    global depth
    depth += 1
    if depth > 12:
        raise RecursionError("parse_E called itself 12 times, consuming nothing")
    return parse_E_naive(tokens, pos)      # E -> E + T : recurse first, eat nothing

try:
    parse_E_naive(["num", "+", "num"], 0)
except RecursionError as e:
    print(f"  {e}")
    print("  No input was consumed, so the base case is never reachable.")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Reading the Code

- `find_left_recursive` is one comprehension.  The whole test is `rhs[0] == head`: does the rule begin with the nonterminal it defines?
- The two arithmetic grammars accept exactly the same set of strings.  Left recursion is not about *what* a grammar means.  It is only about whether a particular parsing technique can cope with it.
- The last block shows the failure without hanging the cell.  It counts calls instead of waiting for Python's recursion limit.  The diagnostic detail is that `pos` never advances: a recursive call that consumes nothing can never terminate.
- This detector finds only *direct* left recursion.  A grammar with $A \rightarrow B\,\alpha$ and $B \rightarrow A\,\beta$ is indirectly left-recursive and slips past it.  That is a good exercise and a real limitation.

### Try It Yourself

Run the detector on the grammar you will build a parser from.

```python
def find_left_recursive(grammar):
    return {head
            for head, prods in grammar.items()
            for rhs in prods
            if rhs and rhs[0] == head}

# TODO 1: replace this with YOUR team's grammar, in the same dict form.
MY_GRAMMAR = {
    "expr":   [["expr", "+", "term"], ["term"]],
    "term":   [["term", "*", "factor"], ["factor"]],
    "factor": [["(", "expr", ")"], ["num"]],
}

lr = sorted(find_left_recursive(MY_GRAMMAR))
if lr:
    print(f"  LEFT-RECURSIVE: {lr}")
    print("  A recursive-descent parser for this will recurse forever.")
    print("  Rewrite each offending rule in the A -> B A' form and rerun.")
else:
    print("  No direct left recursion. Safe for recursive descent.")

# TODO 2: rewrite the offending rules right-recursively and rerun until the
#         detector reports clean. Keep BOTH versions and confirm they still
#         accept the same strings.

# TODO 3: harder. Write a grammar that is INDIRECTLY left-recursive
#         (A -> B x, B -> A y) and confirm this detector misses it.
#         What would you have to compute to catch that case?
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output as written: `expr` and `term` reported as left-recursive.  Keep rewriting until the detector reports clean.  A clean report is the precondition for the *Recursive Descent Parsing* session.

## Model 5 (At Home): BNF vs EBNF, Two Notations, One Language

This model runs a BNF recognizer and an EBNF recognizer side by side on the same inputs, so you can see that the two notations agree.  After this exercise you should be comfortable translating between the two forms.  You will need that skill when reading language manuals (which often use BNF) and when writing parsers (where EBNF maps more directly to code).

BNF encodes repetition as recursion.  That forces an extra nonterminal and two alternatives for every repeated construct.  EBNF adds `*` and `+` as sugar.  The recognizers below show that both styles accept exactly the same strings for a comma-separated list grammar.

**BNF version** (repetition via recursion):

```
list     -> item list_tail
list_tail -> "," item list_tail | (empty)
item     -> NUMBER
```

EBNF version (repetition via `{ }`):

```
list -> item { "," item }
item -> NUMBER
```

```python
# Both recognizers operate on a flat list of token strings.
# Tokens are "NUM" for any number, "," for comma.

def bnf_list(tokens):
    """BNF-style: list -> item list_tail"""
    pos = bnf_item(tokens, 0)
    if pos is None:
        return False
    pos = bnf_list_tail(tokens, pos)
    return pos == len(tokens)

def bnf_item(tokens, pos):
    if pos < len(tokens) and tokens[pos] == "NUM":
        return pos + 1
    return None

def bnf_list_tail(tokens, pos):
    """list_tail -> ',' item list_tail | epsilon"""
    if pos < len(tokens) and tokens[pos] == ",":
        pos2 = bnf_item(tokens, pos + 1)
        if pos2 is None:
            return pos          # comma with no following item: stay before comma
        return bnf_list_tail(tokens, pos2)
    return pos                  # epsilon: consume nothing

def ebnf_list(tokens):
    """EBNF-style: list -> item { ',' item }"""
    if not tokens or tokens[0] != "NUM":
        return False
    pos = 1
    while pos < len(tokens):
        if tokens[pos] != ",":
            break
        if pos + 1 >= len(tokens) or tokens[pos + 1] != "NUM":
            break
        pos += 2
    return pos == len(tokens)

test_cases = [
    (["NUM"],                               True,  "single item"),
    (["NUM", ",", "NUM"],                   True,  "two items"),
    (["NUM", ",", "NUM", ",", "NUM"],       True,  "three items"),
    ([],                                    False, "empty"),
    (["NUM", ","],                          False, "trailing comma"),
    ([",", "NUM"],                          False, "leading comma"),
    (["NUM", "NUM"],                        False, "missing comma"),
]

print(f"{'description':<20} {'tokens':<30} {'BNF':>4} {'EBNF':>5} {'agree':>6}")
print("-" * 68)
for tokens, expected, label in test_cases:
    b = bnf_list(tokens)
    e = ebnf_list(tokens)
    agree = "YES" if b == e else "NO"
    tok_str = str(tokens)[:28]
    print(f"{label:<20} {tok_str:<30} {str(b):>4} {str(e):>5} {agree:>6}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Critical Thinking Questions

14.  Both columns should agree on every row.  If they disagree, that is a bug in one recognizer; find it and explain the fix.  (They should agree.  This question asks you to *verify* equivalence, not just trust it.)
15.  The BNF version uses recursion; the EBNF version uses a `while` loop.  Which is easier to read, and which maps more directly to the grammar notation?  Does the answer change when the grammar has nested repetition?
16.  The BNF `list_tail` handles the empty case by returning `pos` unchanged.  In a grammar with *two* optional suffixes, what would BNF require that EBNF avoids?

## Model 6 (At Home): FIRST Sets (Preview)

So far you have chosen which rule to apply by hand.  A real parser has to make that choice automatically: when it sees the next token, it needs to know which rule to try.  FIRST sets are the lookup table that answers that question.  Given a nonterminal and the next token, which alternative fires?  This model gives you an early look at that machinery before we cover it in depth later.

The *FIRST set* of a grammar symbol is the set of terminals that can begin a string derivable from that symbol.  Parsers use FIRST sets to decide which rule to apply without backtracking: if the next token is in `FIRST(A)`, try rule A.  Computing FIRST sets is a fixed-point algorithm.  Start with the obvious cases (a terminal's FIRST is itself, and an epsilon production contributes epsilon), then iterate until nothing changes.

```python
# Grammar for arithmetic expressions (token-level, no whitespace).
# We represent each production as a list of symbols.
# "" means epsilon (empty string).

PRODS = {
    "expr":      [["term", "expr_rest"]],
    "expr_rest": [["+", "term", "expr_rest"],
                  ["-", "term", "expr_rest"],
                  [""]],                       # epsilon
    "term":      [["factor", "term_rest"]],
    "term_rest": [["*", "factor", "term_rest"],
                  ["/", "factor", "term_rest"],
                  [""]],
    "factor":    [["NUM"], ["(", "expr", ")"]],
}
NONTERMINALS = set(PRODS.keys())
EPSILON = ""

def compute_first(prods):
    first = {nt: set() for nt in prods}

    def first_of_symbol(sym):

### Critical Thinking Questions

17. `FIRST(expr)` and `FIRST(term)` should be identical.  Explain why: trace the derivation path from `expr` to see which terminals can appear first.
18. `FIRST(expr_rest)` contains `+`, `-`, and `ε`.  Why does the presence of `ε` in a FIRST set matter to a parser when `expr_rest` appears in the *middle* of a longer alternative like `["term", "expr_rest"]`?
19.  The algorithm iterates until `changed` is False (a fixed-point computation).  Construct a tiny grammar where the FIRST set of one nonterminal only becomes complete after *two* iterations, and trace the two rounds.
20.  FOLLOW sets (which tokens can come *after* a nonterminal) are needed alongside FIRST sets to build a complete LL(1) parse table.  Without computing them, predict: what would `FOLLOW(expr_rest)` contain in this grammar, and why?

# Check Your Understanding

EBNF adds `[...]`, `{...}` and `(...)` to BNF.  What does that buy?

[(X)] Convenience only: EBNF describes exactly the same class of languages as BNF, more compactly
[( )] Strictly more power: some languages need EBNF and cannot be written in BNF
[( )] The ability to describe context-sensitive languages
[( )] Faster parsing at run time

---

Transcribing `[sign] digit {digit}` into code turns `[...]` into an `if` and `{...}` into a `while`.  That correspondence matters because:

[(X)] It is the recipe recursive descent generalizes: each grammar construct becomes one control structure
[( )] It proves the grammar is unambiguous
[( )] It is the only way to recognize integers
[( )] `if` and `while` are the only statements a parser may use

---

`E -> E + T | T` is left-recursive.  A recursive-descent parser written directly from it:

[(X)] Calls `parse_E` as its first action having consumed no input, so it never reaches a base case
[( )] Parses correctly but builds a right-leaning tree
[( )] Accepts a different language than the right-recursive version
[( )] Works, but only for inputs shorter than the recursion limit

---

The left-recursive and right-recursive arithmetic grammars differ in:

[(X)] Tree shape and parseability, not in the set of strings they accept
[( )] The set of strings they accept
[( )] Whether they are context-free
[( )] Nothing; they are the same grammar written twice

---

`find_left_recursive` reports nothing for a grammar with `A -> B x` and `B -> A y`.  That grammar is:

[(X)] Indirectly left-recursive, which this detector does not catch
[( )] Not left-recursive at all, so the report is correct
[( )] Ambiguous rather than left-recursive
[( )] Not a context-free grammar

---

## Exercises

These exercises ask you to write grammars from scratch, which is harder than reading them.  Start by listing a few example strings the grammar should accept.  Then work out what rule structure generates all of them.  The final exercise seeds your project grammar, so keep what you write.

1.  *Phone grammar.*  Write EBNF for US phone numbers allowing `610-409-3000`, `(610) 409-3000`, and `6104093000`.  Trade with another team and find one string their grammar accepts that yours rejects.
2.  *List literal.*  Write EBNF for Python-style list literals of integers: `[]`, `[1]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, with no trailing comma.  The comma placement is the lesson; expect a false start.
3.  *Recognizer extension.*  Extend the code cell to recognize your phone-number grammar, keeping the construct-to-code mapping (optional becomes `if`, repetition becomes `while`).  Report your test cases and results.
4.  *Project seed.*  Draft the EBNF for *one* statement form you want in your team's language (a loop, a print, a let-binding).  Keep it; these drafts accumulate into your project's grammar.

## Practice (At Home): Allison, Ch. 4: Hand-Traced Grammar Recognition

These exercises build confidence in the mapping between notation and code.  You write small recognizer functions from grammar rules and trace them on sample inputs.  They directly support the *Recursive Descent Parsing* activity and the Parser assignment.

> *Exercises adapted from topics covered in *Foundations of Computing* by Chuck Allison (Fresh Sources, Inc.), used under the [MIT License](https://github.com/chuckallison/foundations-of-computing/blob/main/LICENSE).*

In a recognizer function for `IDENT "=" expr`, if the input is `x = 2 + 3`, which of the following matches?

[( )] The entire string is one IDENT
[(X)] IDENT matches `x`, literal `=` matches `=`, IDENT for `expr` would attempt to match `2` (and fail because `2` is not an identifier)
[( )] The rule accepts any input as long as the characters `=` appears somewhere
[( )] IDENT, `=`, and expr all must match *exactly once* each, in any order

For the grammar rule `expr -> term { ('+' | '-') term }`, the { ... } repetition becomes a `while` loop in code.  The loop continues as long as:

[( )] There are more tokens
[(X)] The next token is `+` or `-` (i.e., matches one of the alternatives inside the braces)
[( )] The parser has consumed at least one term
[( )] End of input is not reached

1.  **Write a recognizer from a grammar rule.**
   Grammar: `identifier -> LETTER { LETTER | DIGIT | '_' }`
   Write a Python function `recognize_identifier(tokens, pos)` that:
   - Checks if `tokens[pos]` is a LETTER
   - Loops while `tokens[pos+i]` is a LETTER, DIGIT, or underscore
   - Returns the position after the last valid character (or None if the first character is not a LETTER)
   
   Test: `recognize_identifier(['x','1','2','_'], 0)` should return 4 (consumed all).
   Test: `recognize_identifier(['1','2','x'], 0)` should return None (first token not a LETTER).

2.  **Trace a recognizer on input.**
   Grammar: `list -> INT { ',' INT }`
   Function (provided):
   ```python
   def recognize_list(tokens, pos):
       if pos >= len(tokens) or tokens[pos] != 'INT':
           return None
       pos += 1
       while pos < len(tokens) and tokens[pos] == ',':
           if pos + 1 >= len(tokens) or tokens[pos + 1] != 'INT':
               return pos   # trailing comma error: stop here
           pos += 2
       return pos
   ```
   
   Trace on input `['INT', ',', 'INT', ',', 'INT']`:
   - Initial: `pos = 0`, first token is INT -> advance to `pos = 1`
   - Loop iteration 1: token at `pos=1` is `,` -> advance to `pos=2`, check `pos+1=3` is INT -> advance to `pos=3`
   - Loop iteration 2: token at `pos=3` is `,` -> advance to `pos=4`, check `pos+1=5` is beyond bounds -> return 4
   - Result: the recognizer returns 4, but there are 5 tokens.  Explain why it stops early.

3.  **Implement optional groups.**
   Grammar: `declaration -> 'let' IDENT [ '=' expr ]` (where `[ ]` means optional)
   
   Write `recognize_declaration(tokens, pos)` that:
   - Expects `let` at the current position
   - Expects IDENT next
   - Checks if the next token is `=`; if yes, expects an expr after it; if no, stops (expr is optional)
   
   Test on: `['let', 'x']` (should return 2, no `=` found)
   Test on: `['let', 'x', '=', 'INT']` (should return 4, `=` and expr found)

4.  **Precedence via rule nesting.**
   Grammar:
   ```
   expr -> term { '+' term }
   term -> factor { '*' factor }
   factor -> INT | '(' expr ')'
   ```
   
   Write all three recognizer functions.  Trace on input `['INT', '+', 'INT', '*', 'INT']`:
   - Call `recognize_expr` at position 0
   - Inside: calls `recognize_term` -> calls `recognize_factor` -> consumes INT at 0 -> returns 1
   - Loop in expr: token at 1 is `+` -> loop body calls `recognize_term` again -> which eventually consumes tokens 2-4 (INT * INT)
   - Final result: which function recognized the entire input, and did the tree reflect correct precedence (multiplication before addition)?

5.  **Error position reporting.**
   Grammar: `statement -> 'print' expr ';'`
   
   Function:
   ```python
   def recognize_statement(tokens, pos):
       if pos >= len(tokens) or tokens[pos] != 'print':
           return (None, pos)
       pos += 1
       new_pos = recognize_expr(tokens, pos)
       if new_pos is None:
           return (None, pos)   # error: return position where expr failed
       if new_pos >= len(tokens) or tokens[new_pos] != ';':
           return (None, new_pos)  # error: return position where semicolon missing
       return (new_pos + 1, None)
   ```
   
   Input: `['print', 'IDENT', 'PLUS']` (missing semicolon)
   Trace: why does the function return `(None, 3)` rather than `(None, 2)`?  How would you improve the error message to say "expected `;` at position 3" rather than just returning position 3?

## Reflection Prompt

In your notebook: BNF was introduced in 1959 to define ALGOL, and it remains in every language manual today.  Why do you think this one notation outlived nearly everything else from that era?  What property would a replacement need?
