# Closures and First-Class Functions

A closure is a function packaged together with the environment that was in force when the function was created.  That package is how a function can still read a variable after the scope that created the variable has returned.  Closures are the mechanism behind callbacks, iterators, and the functional style of JavaScript, Python, and Scheme.  Once you can trace a closure, you understand how scope and state behave at runtime.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Define a closure as a pair of code and its defining environment, and explain why a language with first-class functions and static scope needs it
- Trace environment diagrams for closure creation and invocation, identifying captured variable bindings and parent environment pointers
- Implement closure creation and application in an interpreter by storing and restoring the defining environment at call time
- Identify the loop-variable capture trap and explain why closures in loops capture a reference rather than a value
- Compare closures and objects as dual mechanisms for bundling state with behavior

Your team's language is underway after the *Language Design Workshop* kickoff, and today ties two earlier ideas together.  A language has **first-class functions** when a function is an ordinary value: you can store it in a variable, pass it as an argument, and return it from another function.  A language has static scope when a name refers to the variable declared where the function was written.  Put those two rules together and a function can escape the scope where it was born.  To keep working, it must carry that scope with it.  What it carries is the environment model you built in *Environments and Variable Storage*.  The bundle of code plus captured environment is a closure.  It is the mechanism behind `make_adder`, behind every Church encoding, and behind the `FunDef` node your interpreter will support.

Today's arc runs in five steps: the problem closures solve, the mechanism drawn precisely, closures in your own interpreter, the loop-variable trap, and objects compared with closures.

> **Before You Begin:** This activity assumes you can:
> - Define what an environment (scope chain) is, and trace a simple variable lookup through nested scopes
> - Explain the difference between a value and a binding, and describe what it means for a variable to "go out of scope"
> - Read and write basic Python functions, including functions that define and return inner functions
>
> If any of these feel shaky, review the *Environments and Variable Storage* activity before continuing.

## Directions and Group Roles

Work in your POGIL team with your rotated roles (**Manager**, **Recorder**, **Presenter**, **Reflector**).  Think each model through on your own first, then talk it over with your group.  The Recorder posts your answers to the Class Activity Questions discussion board.  The Presenter reports out wherever you disagreed or found another approach.  After class, respond to the reflective prompt on your own in your notebook.

---

## Key Concepts

This glossary defines the terms the activity uses.  Come back to it whenever a term starts to feel slippery.

| Term | Plain-English meaning | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Closure** | A function bundled with the environment where it was defined | The mechanism that lets a function read variables after their scope ends |
| **First-class function** | A function treated as an ordinary value: stored, passed, returned | Without this, closures never arise; with it, they are unavoidable |
| **Defining environment** | The scope chain in effect at the moment a function is created | This is what the closure captures, never the caller's environment |
| **Captured variable** | A variable from an enclosing scope that an inner function reads or writes | The closure keeps that variable alive after its scope returns |
| **Capture by reference** | The closure holds a pointer to the *binding*, not a snapshot of the value | Explains why closures see later changes, and the loop-variable trap |
| **Lexical (static) scope** | Names resolve where the function was *written* in the source | The rule Python, JavaScript, and Scheme use; implemented by one parent-pointer choice |
| **Dynamic scope** | Names resolve in whoever *called* the function | The historical alternative; a contrast that shows what lexical scope buys |
| **Environment diagram** | Boxes for scopes, arrows for parent and capture pointers | The picture that makes every closure question answerable |
| **Loop-variable trap** | All closures made in a loop share one binding, so all see its final value | The most common closure bug in Python and JavaScript alike |
| **Factory function** | A function whose every call creates a fresh scope and returns a closure over it | The standard fix for the trap, and the pattern behind `make_adder` |
| **Mutable cell / `nonlocal`** | The way an inner function assigns into a captured binding | How closures hold changing *state* as well as constants |

---

# Part I: The Problem and the Mechanism

A function defined inside another function keeps reading the variables of its birth environment after the enclosing function has returned.  One analogy: a contractor trained in your workshop still knows the workshop's tools and rules after the workshop closes.  The analogy stops there, because the contractor carries a memory of the workshop while a closure carries a live link to it.  This section uses the classic `make_adder` example to show why this behavior is necessary and useful.

## 1.  A Function Outlives Its Scope

```python
def make_adder(n):
    def adder(x):
        return x + n
    return adder

add5  = make_adder(5)
add10 = make_adder(10)

print(f"add5(3)  = {add5(3)}")    # 8
print(f"add10(3) = {add10(3)}")   # 13

# make_adder has RETURNED, yet n=5 and n=10 still live somewhere.
# Where?
print(f"add5's closure cells: {add5.__closure__[0].cell_contents}")
print(f"add10's closure cells: {add10.__closure__[0].cell_contents}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

By the lifetime rules of the environments module, `make_adder`'s local scope should die at `return` and take `n` with it.  Yet `add5` still finds `n = 5`.  The resolution is that **a function value is not just code; it is a closure**, a pair of `(code, defining_environment)`.  When Python created `adder`, it captured a reference to the environment where `n` was bound.  That environment survives because the closure still points to it.  Lifetime follows reachability.

$$\text{closure} = \langle \text{params}, \text{body}, E_{\text{def}} \rangle$$

Calling a closure brings its birthplace back into use.  The call `add5(10)` creates a fresh environment for the parameter (`x = 10`).  The parent of that environment is the closure's captured environment (where `n = 5`), not the caller's environment.  That parent choice is static scoping enforced at runtime.  The entire difference between lexical and dynamic scope is one decision about which parent pointer to use.

Remember two things from this section.  A closure is code plus its defining environment.  A call runs the body in a child of that captured environment.

**Critical Thinking Questions (CTQs)**

> **CTQ 1.1** Draw the environment diagram at `print(add5(3))`: the global frame, the still-alive `make_adder` frame holding `n = 5`, the call frame holding `x = 3`, and every parent arrow.  Which arrow embodies "static scope"?

> **CTQ 1.2** After `add5 = make_adder(5)` and `add10 = make_adder(10)`, how many `make_adder` environments exist at the same time?  What does each closure's captured pointer tell you about whether closures *copy* or *reference* their environment?

> **CTQ 1.3** In the lambda calculus, `(λn. λx. x + n) 5` reduces to `λx. x + 5` by *substitution*: the 5 is pasted into the body.  State the relationship: closures are an *implementation strategy* for what substitution *specifies*.  Why might an interpreter prefer environments over literal substitution for large function bodies?

---

A closure holds a live reference to a variable binding.  Any change to that variable after the closure is created is visible through the closure.  One analogy: a closure is a security camera pointed at a shelf, not a photograph of the shelf.  When you look at the feed later, you see whatever is on the shelf now.  The analogy stops at the camera's one-way view, because a closure can also write to the shelf through `nonlocal` or a mutable cell.

> **Watch out!**  A common mistake is to think a closure *copies* the value of a variable at the moment the closure is created.  It does not.  It captures a *reference* to the binding.  If the variable changes after the closure is defined, the closure sees the new value.  The `get_x` example below demonstrates this directly.

## Model 1: Closures Capture, Not Copy

```python
# CRITICAL: closures capture the VARIABLE BINDING, not the value at capture time

x = 10

def get_x():
    return x    # captures the variable x, not the value 10

print(f"get_x() = {get_x()}")   # 10

x = 99
print(f"After x=99, get_x() = {get_x()}")   # 99, the closure sees the new value!

# Contrast: a default argument captures the VALUE at definition time
def get_x_snapshot(val=x):
    return val

x = 42
print(f"get_x_snapshot() = {get_x_snapshot()}")   # 99, not 42, captured at def time

# Multiple closures sharing a mutable cell:
def make_counter():
    count = [0]   # list so we can mutate it (Python 2 workaround; Python 3 uses nonlocal)
    def increment():
        count[0] += 1
        return count[0]
    def reset():
        count[0] = 0
    return increment, reset

inc, rst = make_counter()
print(inc(), inc(), inc())   # 1 2 3
rst()
print(inc())                 # 1, both closures share the same count cell
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

> **CTQ 1.4** `get_x()` returns 99 after `x = 99`.  What does this prove about whether closures copy or reference the captured binding?

> **CTQ 1.5** The `make_counter` example has TWO closures (`increment` and `reset`) that share ONE captured environment containing `count`.  Draw the environment diagram.  Which arrow makes them share state?

---

Model 2, below, contrasts two scope rules.  Under lexical scope, a function looks names up in the environment where the function was *defined*.  Under dynamic scope, a function looks names up in the environment of whoever *called* it.  One analogy: one employee checks the handbook from the office where they were trained, and another asks whoever is standing next to them right now.  The analogy stops at the people, because a function never chooses; the language fixes the rule for every call.  Python uses lexical scope.

> **Watch out!**  Students sometimes expect that calling a function from inside another function lets the called function "see" the caller's local variables.  That would be dynamic scope, and Python does *not* work that way.  The `show()` / `demo()` example in Model 2 will surprise you if you carry this assumption in.

### Reading the Code

These notes cover the Model 1 code.

- The first block reassigns the captured variable *after* the closure is built, and the closure reports the new value.  That proves capture by reference.  If the closure had copied, it would still report the old value.
- The default-argument contrast is the control case.  `get_x_snapshot(val=x)` evaluates `x` once, at definition, and stores the result in `val`.  It is not a closure over `x` at all.
- The shared-mutable-cell block is the same mechanism used on purpose.  Two functions closing over one binding is how you get an object with two methods, which is where the Extension on closures and objects goes.

### Try It Yourself

Find out, by experiment, exactly what Python keeps in a closure.

```python
def make():
    secret = "original"
    hidden  = "never used by the inner function"
    def peek():
        return secret            # only 'secret' is referenced
    def poke(v):
        nonlocal secret
        secret = v
    return peek, poke

peek, poke = make()
print("=== Capture is by reference, not by value ===")
print(f"  peek()          -> {peek()!r}")
poke("changed")
print(f"  after poke      -> {peek()!r}")

print("\n=== What is actually in the closure? ===")
names = peek.__code__.co_freevars
cells = [c.cell_contents for c in (peek.__closure__ or ())]
print(f"  peek captured: {dict(zip(names, cells))}")

# TODO 1: 'hidden' was in scope when peek was defined, but is it captured?
#         Look at the printed dict and say why or why not. What does that
#         tell you about what a closure costs in memory?

# TODO 2: peek and poke were made by the SAME call to make(). Print
#         poke.__closure__ too and compare the cell objects with
#         `peek.__closure__[0] is poke.__closure__[0]`. What does the
#         answer say about how they share state?

# TODO 3: call make() a second time and confirm the new peek is unaffected
#         by the old poke. How many 'secret' variables exist now?
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output: `'original'`, then `'changed'`, then a dict with exactly one entry.  The absence of `hidden` from that dict is the answer to TODO 1.

## Model 2: Lexical vs. Dynamic Scope

```python
# Python uses LEXICAL (static) scope.
# Simulate what DYNAMIC scope would look like.

x = "global"

def show():
    print(f"show sees x = {x}")  # always sees x from DEFINING scope (global)

def demo():
    x = "demo"     # local x in demo's frame
    show()         # show() is NOT affected by demo's x

demo()  # prints "global", static scope: show sees the global x

# What dynamic scope would look like (manually simulated):
def show_dynamic(env):
    print(f"show_dynamic sees x = {env.get('x', 'not found')}")

def demo_dynamic():
    local_env = {'x': 'demo'}
    show_dynamic(local_env)   # show uses CALLER's environment

demo_dynamic()  # prints "demo", dynamic scope: show sees caller's x
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

> **CTQ 2.1** Python's `show()` prints `"global"` even when called from `demo()` where `x = "demo"` is in scope.  Explain why, using the environment chain diagram.

> **CTQ 2.2** Early Lisp used dynamic scope by accident.  Under dynamic scope, `show_dynamic(local_env)` prints `"demo"`.  Write a scenario where dynamic scope causes a bug: a function `show_name()` that reads a variable `name` from the environment, and a caller that accidentally shadows `name` with a different value.

> **CTQ 2.3** The single decision that implements static scope in the evaluator is: when creating a closure, save the **defining environment**, not the calling environment.  Locate this decision in Model 3's `Call` branch in Part II.  It is a single line, and the model runs the same program with it set both ways.

---


# Part II: Closures in Your Own Interpreter

## 2.  Theory: One Field, One Line

Part I used Python to show you *its* closures.  Now you build your own.  It takes very little: a closure is a three-field record, and the entire static-versus-dynamic decision is one word in one line.

When the evaluator meets a function expression, it does **not** evaluate the body.  It packages three things and returns them:

```
Closure(param, body, env)
```

The `param` and `body` come straight off the AST.  The third field, `env`, is the environment at the moment the function was created.  This is the function's lexical environment: the scope chain in force where the function appears in the source.  Capturing it is the one thing this record exists to do.

When the evaluator later meets a call, it evaluates the function, evaluates the argument, and then evaluates the body in

```
closure.env.extend(closure.param, argument)
```

Read that line carefully, because the session turns on it.  The body runs in a child of the closure's captured environment, not a child of the environment where the call sits.  Change `closure.env` to the caller's `env` on that one line and you have written a dynamically scoped language.  Nothing else has to change.

## Examples: Which Environment Wins, by Hand

Take this program and work out both answers before running anything:

```
let x = 10 in
let f = fun y -> x + y in
let x = 99 in
  f(1)
```

Fill in the table.  The only question that matters is which `x` the body of `f` sees.

| Rule | Which `x` does `f`'s body find | Result |
|------|-------------------------------|--------|
| Lexical: body runs in a child of `closure.env` | the `x` in scope where `fun` was written | ? |
| Dynamic: body runs in a child of the caller's `env` | the `x` in scope where `f(1)` was written | ? |

Now say which line of code you would change to move from one row to the other.  There is exactly one.

## Model 3: Build the Closure, Then Flip the Switch

This is a complete evaluator for a language with first-class functions.  The `LEXICAL` flag at the top selects which environment a call body runs in, and the *same* program runs under both settings.

### Reading the Code

- The `Fun` branch is three words long and never touches the body.  A function value is *not* a running thing.  It is a suspended thing plus the environment it was suspended in.
- `Closure.env` is the field CTQ 2.3 asks you to find.  The evaluator fills it in at `Fun`, reads it at `Call`, and never modifies it.
- `base = fn.env if lexical else env` is the entire scoping discipline of the language, on one line.  Every hard question about scope reduces to which of those two names you write there.
- `extend` returns a *new* `Env` rather than mutating.  That is what lets two calls to the same closure run without seeing each other's arguments, and it is why recursion works at all.
- `Call` evaluates `fn` and `arg` in the *current* `env` under both settings.  Only the body's environment changes.  Getting that wrong gives a language where even the argument expression resolves strangely.

> **Watch out!**  It is tempting to store the *values* of the free variables in the closure instead of the environment: capture `x = 10` rather than a pointer to the frame holding `x`.  That works until something reassigns `x`.  Then your closure reads a stale copy while Python's would see the update.  Model 1 already showed the difference; this is where you either preserve it or lose it.

Remember two things from this part.  `Fun` captures the defining environment and evaluates nothing.  `Call` extends that captured environment, and swapping it for the caller's environment is the whole difference between lexical and dynamic scope.

### Critical Thinking Questions

> **CTQ 3.1** Run the model and record all four numbers.  For the first program, which result is 11 and which is 100?  Explain each in one sentence using the words "defining" and "calling."

> **CTQ 3.2** `Closure` holds `env`, but `Env.extend` never copies bindings.  If some later statement reassigns `x` in the captured frame, does the closure see the new value or the old one?  Which of the two capture strategies from Model 1 does that make this?

> **CTQ 3.3** Recursion is not implemented anywhere in this evaluator, yet `bump(bump(0))` works.  What would you have to add for a function to call *itself* by name, and why is that harder than it looks?  (Hint: at the moment `Fun` runs, is the function's own name in `env` yet?)

> **CTQ 3.4** Write down what your team's language does, and put it in `SEMANTICS.md` as one sentence naming the environment a call body runs in.

### Try It Yourself

Add recursion, which is the one thing the model above cannot do.

Expected output as written: a `NameError` naming `fact`, with the explanation.  Once TODO 1 is in, `fact(5) = 120`.  Those two lines are why `letrec` exists at all.

# Part III: The Loop-Variable Trap

The loop-variable trap is one of the most common beginner bugs in Python and JavaScript alike.  It happens when every closure created in a loop captures the same variable binding instead of its own private copy.  One analogy: every worker on a factory floor shares one whiteboard for the current job number.  By the time any worker reads the board, the number has moved on to the last job.  The analogy stops at the sharing, because the fix in code is to give each closure its own board, which a factory cannot do by rewriting one line.

> **Watch out!**  When you write `[lambda: i for i in range(3)]`, all three lambdas capture *one* variable `i`, the same loop variable.  By the time any of them is called, the loop has finished and `i` is `2`.  This is not a bug in Python.  It is the correct behavior of reference capture.  The two fixes shown (default argument and factory function) both work by creating a separate binding per iteration.

## 3.  The Famous Python Bug

```python
# The loop-variable trap, every Python programmer falls into this once
fns = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]
print("Results:", [f() for f in fns])     # [2, 2, 2], not [0, 1, 2]!

# Why? All three lambdas captured the SAME binding of 'i'.
# By the time they're called, i == 2.
print("i after loop:", end=" ")
try:
    print(i)  # i still exists after the loop! (Python scoping quirk)
except NameError:
    print("not available")

# Fix 1: default argument captures VALUE at definition time
fns_fixed1 = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(3)]
print("Fix 1 (default arg):", [f() for f in fns_fixed1])   # [0, 1, 2]

# Fix 2: factory function creates a new scope per iteration
def make_fn(i):
    return lambda: i

fns_fixed2 = [make_fn(i) for i in range(3)]
print("Fix 2 (factory):", [f() for f in fns_fixed2])   # [0, 1, 2]

# The lesson: each iteration needs its OWN binding, not a shared one
# JavaScript's 'let' fixed this at the ecosystem scale (was 'var' before)
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

> **CTQ 6.1** All three lambdas captured the same `i` binding.  After the loop, what is `i`?  Why do all three lambdas return 2?

> **CTQ 6.2** Fix 1 uses `lambda i=i: i`.  Python evaluates the outer `i` (the default argument value) at *definition time*, which captures the current value.  Why does this work, while the capture in the original version does not?

> **CTQ 6.3** Fix 2 uses a factory function `make_fn(i)` that creates a new scope.  Draw the environment diagram showing why each returned lambda has a *different* captured environment.

> **CTQ 6.4** JavaScript's historic `var` scoping caused the same bug; `let` was introduced to fix it.  How does `let` create "per-iteration" scope?  Why can't `var` do this?

---

The code above showed the trap and two fixes.  The notes below explain the code, the Try It Yourself asks you to predict five variants, and Model 5 then draws the trap as boxes.  The broken and fixed versions differ by exactly one thing (how many environment boxes exist), and the box diagram makes the bug visible at a glance.

### Reading the Code

- `[lambda: i for i in range(3)]` builds three functions that all close over the *same* `i`.  Nothing about that is a bug.  It is capture-by-reference doing exactly what Model 1 demonstrated on purpose.
- The two fixes attack different halves.  The default argument stops closing over `i` at all, so there is nothing to share.  The factory function makes a new binding per iteration, so there are three `i`s to close over instead of one.
- JavaScript's `var` had this exact shape, and `let` changed it by giving loop bodies per-iteration bindings.  You made the same decision in the *Environments* Try It Yourself, at ecosystem scale.

### Try It Yourself

Predict, then check, which of these five loops has the trap.

```python
def factory(v):
    return lambda: v

print("=== Five loops. Which give [0, 1, 2]? ===")

a = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]
b = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(3)]
c = [factory(i) for i in range(3)]
d = []
for i in range(3):
    d.append(lambda: i)
e = []
for i in range(3):
    e.append(factory(i))

# TODO: predict all five BEFORE running. Write your predictions down.
for name, fns in [("a  comprehension, bare lambda", a),
                  ("b  comprehension, default arg", b),
                  ("c  comprehension, factory    ", c),
                  ("d  for-loop, bare lambda     ", d),
                  ("e  for-loop, factory         ", e)]:
    print(f"  {name} -> {[f() for f in fns]}")

print("\nTwo of these share one binding and three do not.")
print("For each, say WHERE the per-iteration binding comes from,")
print("or why there isn't one.")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output: `a` and `d` give `[2, 2, 2]`; `b`, `c`, and `e` give `[0, 1, 2]`.  If you predicted the comprehension and the for-loop would differ, note that they do not.  The comprehension's scope is not what saves you.

## Model 5: The Loop Trap, Drawn as Boxes

**Broken:** `fns = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]`.  The comprehension runs in a single scope, so there is exactly one box holding `i`, and every lambda's capture arrow points at it:

```
        +----------------------------+
        | comprehension scope        |
        |   i = 2   (final value)    |
        +----------------------------+
             ^         ^         ^
             |         |         |
           lam0      lam1      lam2
   three closures, ONE shared box: all see i = 2 at call time
```

**Fixed (factory):** `fns = [make_fn(i) for i in range(3)]`.  Each *call* to `make_fn` creates a fresh box, and each lambda captures its own:

```
   +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+
   | E0: i = 0 |   | E1: i = 1 |   | E2: i = 2 |
   +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+
        ^               ^               ^
        |               |               |
      lam0            lam1            lam2
   three closures, three boxes: one binding per closure
```

Here is the broken version's history as a timeline.  The trap is a *timing* bug: capture is by reference, and the calls happen after the last write.

| Loop step | Shared box's `i` | Closures created so far | What each would return *if called now* |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| iteration 0 | 0 | lam0 | lam0 -> 0 |
| iteration 1 | 1 | lam0, lam1 | both -> 1 |
| iteration 2 | 2 | lam0, lam1, lam2 | all -> 2 |
| after the loop (calls happen here) | 2 | all three | **all -> 2** |

```python
# Evidence for the diagrams: inspect the closure cells directly
broken = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]
print("broken results:", [f() for f in broken])
print("one shared box?",
      broken[0].__closure__[0] is broken[1].__closure__[0] is broken[2].__closure__[0])

def make_fn(i):
    return lambda: i

fixed = [make_fn(i) for i in range(3)]
print("\nfixed results:", [f() for f in fixed])
print("distinct boxes?",
      fixed[0].__closure__[0] is not fixed[1].__closure__[0])
print("each box's contents:", [f.__closure__[0].cell_contents for f in fixed])

# Fix 1 (default argument) is different again: no closure at all
fix1 = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(3)]
print("\nfix1 results:", [f() for f in fix1])
print("fix1 closures:", [f.__closure__ for f in fix1])   # [None, None, None]
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

`fns = [lambda: i for i in range(3)]` yields functions that all return 2, and `fns[0].__closure__[0] is fns[1].__closure__[0]` prints `True`.  Together these show:

[( )] The lambdas were compiled to the same code object, which forces one result
[(X)] All three closures captured the very same binding (cell) for `i`, whose final value is 2
[( )] Python evaluates lambda bodies eagerly at definition time
[( )] The list comprehension copied the last lambda three times

Remember two things from this part.  Closures made in one scope share one binding, so they all see its final value.  A factory call makes a fresh scope, so each closure gets its own binding.

**Critical Thinking Questions (CTQs)**

> **CTQ 7.1** Which single line of the cell's output is direct evidence for the "three arrows, one box" picture?  Which line is evidence for "three boxes"?

> **CTQ 7.2** In the fixed diagram, what act creates each new box: the `lambda` *definition*, or the *call* to `make_fn`?  Justify your answer with the environment-creation rule from Part II (`eval_call` builds a new environment per call).

> **CTQ 7.3** Fix 1's lambdas report `__closure__ = None`; they are not closures at all.  Where does each one's `i` live instead, and why does that location make capture unnecessary?

---

Two closures created by separate calls to `make_adder(5)` and `make_adder(3)` return different results for the same input because:

[( )] The function body's code differs between them
[(X)] Each closure captured a different defining environment in which `n` is bound to a different value
[( )] Python caches the most recent return value
[( )] Closures copy the global environment at call time

---

**In-class work stops here.**  Everything below is homework and going-deeper material.  Attempt the exercises before the related assignment.

# Extension: Closures vs. Objects

Objects and closures do the same job.  Both bundle state with behavior, and both control which code can reach that state.  They look different at first: an object is a class instance with named fields, and a closure is a function bundled with hidden environment variables.  This model builds a counter both ways, side by side, so you can see the parallel directly.

> **Watch out!**  Closures are not limited to functional languages.  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Java (through lambdas) all have closures.  A common misconception is that "closures = Haskell/Scheme only."  In modern JavaScript, you use a closure every time you write a callback, an event handler, or a `useEffect` hook in React.

## 4.  Closures and Objects Are Two Views of One Idea

A well-known saying in the field puts it this way: "Closures are a poor man's objects; objects are a poor man's closures."  Each can stand in for the other.  They are dual.

```python
# Objects approach: counter using a class
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self._count = start
    def increment(self):
        self._count += 1
        return self._count
    def reset(self):
        self._count = 0
    def value(self):
        return self._count

# Closures approach: counter using closures (no class!)
def make_counter(start=0):
    count = [start]   # mutable cell
    return {
        'increment': lambda: (count.__setitem__(0, count[0] + 1), count[0])[1],
        'reset':     lambda: count.__setitem__(0, 0),
        'value':     lambda: count[0],
    }

obj_counter = Counter(0)
clo_counter = make_counter(0)

obj_counter.increment(); obj_counter.increment()
print(f"Object counter: {obj_counter.value()}")

clo_counter['increment'](); clo_counter['increment']()
print(f"Closure counter: {clo_counter['value']()}")

# Both share mutable state via different mechanisms:
# Object: self._count (field in object's dictionary)
# Closure: count (binding in captured environment)
# They are structurally dual.
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

> **CTQ 8.1** In the closure-based counter, `count` is a shared mutable cell.  In the object-based counter, `self._count` is a field.  What is the structural difference?  What is the conceptual difference?

> **CTQ 8.2** The closure counter uses a list `[start]` to work around Python's scoping rules for `nonlocal`.  Rewrite it using `nonlocal count` (Python 3) instead of a list.  Why is `nonlocal` cleaner?

> **CTQ 8.3** Languages like OCaml and Haskell have closures but no classes.  Languages like Java (pre-lambda) have classes but no closures (lambdas are objects).  From what you now know about the implementation of each, argue: which is more fundamental?

## 5.  Two Ways to Get What the Calculus Lacks

In *Church Encodings and Combinators*, you derived $\textbf{Y}$ and then $\textbf{Z}$, and used them to make a function call itself with no name anywhere in the term.  `fact-generator` took "the rest of the recursion" as an ordinary parameter, and the combinator supplied it.  Nothing was captured and nothing was mutated.  There was only application and substitution.

Today's mechanism is nothing like that.  A closure gets its power from holding on to a *binding*, and `set!` gets its power from writing to that binding.  The counter remembers because the frame outlived the call that made it, and because somebody was allowed to change what the frame holds.

The two mechanisms are unrelated.  One is pure and needs no notion of memory at all; the other is nothing but memory.  Neither is derivable from the other in any obvious way.  And yet both exist to buy the same missing thing.  The bare calculus gives you no way to refer back to something, whether that something is a function you are in the middle of defining or a value you set on the last call.  The combinator buys self-reference without names.  The closure buys names that persist without a global.

This is also why CTQ 3.3 was harder than it looked.  When `Fun` runs, the function's own name is not in `env` yet, so a closure cannot capture it.  The fix in the Try It Yourself is to reach into the captured environment afterward and point the name at the closure.  That is called *tying the knot*, and it is the mutation-based answer to exactly the problem $\textbf{Y}$ solves without mutation.  Your interpreter is free to pick either one.  Most real languages pick the knot, because it is cheaper and because programmers want to write the name.

> **CTQ 9.1** Scheme ships both mechanisms.  Write `factorial` twice, once with `define` and a self-reference, once with $\textbf{Z}$ and a generator.  Which one would you hand a first-year student, and which one would you rather implement in your evaluator?  Notice those may not be the same answer.

> **CTQ 9.2** Tying the knot creates a cycle: an environment holds a closure whose captured environment is that same environment.  $\textbf{Z}$ creates no cycle at all.  What does that difference cost a garbage collector, and does it change your answer to CTQ 9.1?

> **CTQ 9.3** A memoized function keeps a cache in a captured binding, so it mutates on every miss.  Could you memoize a $\textbf{Z}$-built function without introducing any mutation?  If not, say precisely what would have to change about the language.

# Check Your Understanding

A closure is created when the evaluator meets a function expression. What does it store?

[(X)] The parameter, the unevaluated body, and the environment in force at that moment
[( )] The parameter, the body, and the values of every free variable, copied out
[( )] The fully evaluated body, ready to return on the next call
[( )] Only the body; the environment is looked up again at call time

---

In Model 3, changing `base = fn.env` to `base = env` in the `Call` branch turns the language from lexically scoped to dynamically scoped. Why is that one line enough?

[(X)] It is the only place the body's environment is chosen; everything else already threads environments unchanged
[( )] It also changes how `Fun` captures, because the two share a reference
[( )] It changes name lookup, which is what scope means
[( )] It is not enough; `Env.lookup` must change too

---

`fact(5)` raises `NameError` in the Try It Yourself because:

[(X)] The closure captured the environment *before* `fact` was bound into it, so the body cannot see its own name
[( )] Recursion requires a stack, which the evaluator does not have
[( )] `If0` evaluates both branches, so it never terminates
[( )] `Let` does not extend the environment

---

`[lambda: i for i in range(3)]` returns three functions that all print `2`. This is because:

[(X)] All three closed over the same binding of `i`, and by call time it holds the loop's final value
[( )] Python evaluates lambdas lazily and only the last one survives
[( )] List comprehensions reuse one function object
[( )] `range(3)` is exhausted before the lambdas run

---

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Integrate Closures into Mini (30 min)

Add closures to your Mini interpreter:
1.  Add `FunDef(name, params, body)` and `Call(callee, args)` AST nodes
2.  In the parser, add `fun name(params) { body }` syntax and `name(args)` call syntax
3.  In the evaluator, implement `execute_fundef` (create closure, bind name) and `eval_call` (create child env, run body, catch ReturnSignal)
4.  Demonstrate: a plain function, `factorial(5)`, and `make_adder` working in your language

### Exercise 2: Counter Objects (15 min)

Build `make_counter()` using closures (not a class) that returns an increment function.  Then build `make_account(balance)` with `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)` methods.  Demonstrate shared state between the two returned functions.

### Exercise 3: Trap Tour (15 min)

Reproduce the loop-variable trap in your language (or Python), apply both fixes, and explain each fix's mechanism with environment diagrams.

### Exercise 4: Scope Flip Experiment (20 min)

Apply the one-token change from Model 3 (CTQ 3.1) to make your interpreter dynamically scoped.  Rerun the `show`/`demo` program from the *Binding and Scope* activity.  Report the output difference and explain with a diagram which environment chain the dynamically scoped version follows.

---

## Reflection Prompt

A closure carries its context everywhere, so it always means what it meant at home.  Dynamically scoped code means whatever its surroundings currently impose.  People can resemble both: some carry their context everywhere; others adapt to whoever is calling.  When has carrying your own context served you, and when has adapting to the caller been the wiser semantics?

## Going Further (at home)

The core lesson above stands on its own.  Two self-paced tutorials extend today's mechanism into runtime territory that feeds the Interpreter assignment's extensions and the team project:

Closures complete the environment story your Interpreter assignment depends on.  Next, the *Modern Language Features* activity surveys how today's languages package these mechanics, and your team carries both into the sprint studios.
