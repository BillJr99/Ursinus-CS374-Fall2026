# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions sit at the formal foundation of every programming language: they are the notation that defines what a *token* looks like before a parser ever sees it.  Think of a regex as a cookie cutter.  It describes a precise shape that can stamp out any number of matching strings from the dough of possible input, without caring what flavor the dough is.  Because a single pattern can describe an infinite set of strings (every valid identifier, say), regular expressions give language designers a compact, mathematically grounded way to specify lexical rules.

## Learning Goals

By the end of *today*, you will be able to:

- Define the three fundamental regular expression operators (concatenation, alternation, Kleene star) and construct regular expressions for specified string sets using only these operators
- Trace a regular expression against a target string to predict whether it matches, citing operator precedence rules where applicable
- Show that every convenience of practical regex syntax (`+`, `?`, `[a-z]`, `{n,m}`) is shorthand, by rewriting a pattern in the three primitives and demonstrating the two describe the same language
- Write the regular expression for a programming language token type (identifier, integer literal, floating-point literal) suitable for use in a lexer specification
- Search a source tree with `grep`, choosing the right flags and avoiding the BRE-versus-ERE trap

Day 2 takes these into practice: Python's `re` in five verbs, how the engine backtracks, greed, and the point where regular expressions run out of power.

The Chomsky hierarchy's bottom rung (mapped in *Grammars and the Chomsky Hierarchy*), regular languages, comes with the most widely used notation in computing.  Today: **the three operators $\rightarrow$ precedence $\rightarrow$ from primitives to real token patterns $\rightarrow$ regex at the shell**.

> **Before You Begin**, make sure you are comfortable with the following:
>
> - **Lexers and tokens**: recall that a lexer reads source text and groups characters into *tokens* (an integer literal, an identifier, a keyword).  Its job is essentially pattern matching: each token type has a pattern it must fit.
> - **Finite automata, conceptually**: you do not need to draw one yet, but you should know that a finite automaton is a machine with a fixed set of states and no unbounded memory.  Regular expressions and finite automata turn out to describe exactly the same class of languages; that connection is the bridge to the next module.
> - **Python `re` basics**: you should know how to `import re` and call `re.search`; if not, skim the [Python `re` HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) for five minutes.

## Directions and Group Roles

Work in your POGIL team with your rotated roles (**Manager**, **Recorder**, **Presenter**, **Reflector**).  Every model here is a predict-then-verify exercise: write down what you think each pattern matches *before* you press run.  The patterns where you were wrong are worth more than the ones where you were right, so mark them.  The Recorder posts your answers to the Class Activity Questions discussion board, and the Presenter reports out wherever your team disagreed.

## Key Concepts

A plain-English glossary.  Come back to it whenever one of these starts to feel slippery.

| Term | Plain-English meaning | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Regular expression** | A compact pattern that describes a whole *set* of strings at once | It is the specification language for every token type in your lexer |
| **Concatenation** | Gluing patterns side by side: "this, then that" | The invisible default operator; most of any pattern is concatenation |
| **Alternation (`\|`)** | "Either this or that" | Lets one pattern cover several spellings, like `if\|else\|while` |
| **Kleene star (`*`)** | "Zero or more repeats of the thing just before me" | The only source of infinity in a regex; identifiers of any length need it |
| **Character class (`[0-9]`, `\d`)** | "Any one character from this menu" | Abbreviates long alternations and keeps patterns readable |
| **Anchor (`^`, `$`, `\b`)** | Matches a *position* (start, end, word edge), not a character | Stops a match from beginning or ending mid-word |
| **Capture group `(...)`** | Parentheses that *remember* the text they matched | How you extract data from text rather than merely detect it |
| **Greedy quantifier** | Takes as many characters as it can, giving some back only when forced | Explains most "my regex matched too much" surprises |
| **Token** | The smallest meaningful chunk of source code (a number, a name, an operator) | The lexer's output; each token type is defined by one regex |

# Part I: Three Operators Build Everything

## 1.  Theory: The Entire Toolkit

Every regular expression you will ever write, however elaborate, is built from exactly three primitive ideas.  Convince yourself intuitively before the formalism: you can glue strings together, pick one of several alternatives, and repeat something zero or more times.  That is all of it.

A regular expression denotes a set of strings.  Given expressions $r$ and $s$ denoting languages $L(r)$ and $L(s)$:

$$
\underbrace{r\,s}_{\text{concatenation}} \quad \underbrace{r \mid s}_{\text{alternation (union)}} \quad \underbrace{r^*}_{\text{Kleene star: zero or more}}
$$

plus single characters and the empty string $\varepsilon$.  Everything else in practical regex is shorthand:

$$r^+ = r\,r^* \qquad r? = (r \mid \varepsilon) \qquad [abc] = (a \mid b \mid c)$$

These three operators generate exactly the regular languages: the same class as the Type 3 grammars of the last module and, next module, the finite automata.  Three notations, one idea.

**Precedence.**  Star binds tightest, then concatenation, then alternation.  So `ab*c` is `a`, then zero-or-more `b`, then `c`, and *not* zero-or-more `ab` followed by `c`.  If you want that, you must say `(ab)*c`.  This is the same design move you met in *Derivations, Parse Trees, Ambiguity, and Precedence*: an ambiguous notation is disambiguated by convention, and parentheses override the convention.

> **Watch out!**  The `*` in a regular expression is the **Kleene star**: zero or more repetitions of the preceding element.  It is *not* the glob wildcard you know from the shell, where `*.py` means "any filename ending in `.py`."  In regex, "any characters" is `.*`, and a bare `*` with nothing before it is a syntax error.

## Examples: Parse the Pattern Before You Run It

Read each pattern the way the engine does, left to right, applying precedence.  Fill in the third column with your team *before* looking at any output.

| Pattern | How precedence groups it | What set does it denote? |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `ab*c` | `a` · (`b`)\* · `c` | ? |
| `(ab)*c` | (`a` · `b`)\* · `c` | ? |
| `a(b\|c)d` | `a` · (`b` \| `c`) · `d` | ? |
| `ab\|cd` | (`a` · `b`) \| (`c` · `d`) | ? |
| `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` | one-or-more digits · literal `.` · one-or-more digits | ? |

The fourth row is the one that catches people.  Alternation binds *loosest*, so `ab|cd` is "either `ab` or `cd`", not "`a`, then `b` or `c`, then `d`".  Write out the two-member and one-non-member for each row now.

## Model 1: Read Before You Write

Commit to your predictions above, then run this and mark every row where the machine disagreed with you.

```python
import re

patterns = [
    ("ab*c",            ["ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbbc", "aXc", "abab c".replace(" ", "")]),
    ("(ab)*c",          ["c", "abc", "ababc", "ac", "abbc"]),
    ("a(b|c)d",         ["abd", "acd", "ad", "abcd", "aad"]),
    ("ab|cd",           ["ab", "cd", "abd", "acd", "abcd"]),
    (r"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+", ["3.14", "0.0", "123.456", "3", ".14", "3."]),
]

for pattern, tests in patterns:
    print(f"\nPattern: {pattern!r}")
    for s in tests:
        m = re.fullmatch(pattern, s)
        print(f"  {s!r:12} -> {'MATCH' if m else 'no match'}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Reading the Code

- `re.fullmatch` requires the pattern to consume the **entire** string, which is the right choice for a *theory* demonstration, because a regular expression denotes a set of strings, and `fullmatch` asks exactly "is this string in that set?"  `re.search`, which Day 2 uses, asks a different question: "does the set have a member somewhere inside this string?"
- `r"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"` uses a raw string so that `\.` reaches the regex engine as an escaped dot rather than being interpreted by Python first.  Drop the `r` and Python warns you; get in the habit now.
- `.` matches *any* character, so an unescaped `[0-9]+.[0-9]+` would happily match `3x14`.  The escape is not decoration.

### Critical Thinking Questions

1.  For each pattern, write the denoted set in plain English and give two members and one non-member.  Where did `ab*c` versus `(ab)*c` divide the team?
2.  `ab|cd` rejects `abd` and `acd`.  Explain that using precedence, in one sentence, without using the word "obviously."
3.  Star binds tighter than concatenation, which binds tighter than `|`.  Where have you seen this exact design move before, in *Derivations, Parse Trees, Ambiguity, and Precedence*, and what notation made it unambiguous there?
4.  `re.fullmatch("(ab)*c", "c")` matches.  Which of the three operators makes the empty repetition legal, and what would you write instead if you wanted *at least one* `ab`?

### Try It Yourself

Write patterns for three specified sets, then check them against inputs designed to catch the usual mistakes.

```python
import re

# TODO: replace each None with a pattern using ONLY the three primitives
#       and character classes. No + or ? yet; those come in Part II.
tasks = [
    # (your pattern, description, should_match, should_not_match)
    (None, "any number of a's, then exactly one b",
        ["b", "ab", "aaab"],            ["a", "abb", "ba"]),
    (None, "the words cat or dog, nothing else",
        ["cat", "dog"],                 ["cats", "ca", "catdog"]),
    (None, "a binary string of even length (including empty)",
        ["", "01", "1010"],             ["0", "101"]),
]

for pattern, desc, yes, no in tasks:
    print(f"\n{desc}")
    if pattern is None:
        print("  (not written yet)")
        continue
    print(f"  pattern: {pattern!r}")
    for s in yes:
        ok = re.fullmatch(pattern, s)
        print(f"    {s!r:8} should MATCH   -> {'ok' if ok else 'FAILED'}")
    for s in no:
        ok = re.fullmatch(pattern, s)
        print(f"    {s!r:8} should NOT match -> {'ok' if not ok else 'FAILED'}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output once all three are written: every line reads `ok`.  The third task is the interesting one; think about what "a pair of characters" looks like as a single starred group.

# Part II: From Primitives to Real Token Patterns

## 2.  Theory: All the Convenience Is Sugar

Practical regex syntax is large, and almost none of it adds power.  Each convenience below expands to the three primitives:

| Shorthand | Expansion in primitives | Reads as |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------|
| `r+` | `r r*` | one or more |
| `r?` | `(r \| ε)` | optional |
| `[abc]` | `(a \| b \| c)` | one from the menu |
| `[a-c]` | `(a \| b \| c)` | one from the range |
| `r{2}` | `r r` | exactly two |
| `r{1,3}` | `(r \| rr \| rrr)` | between one and three |

This matters for two reasons.  First, it tells you that the class of languages you can describe never grows, no matter how much syntax a regex dialect piles on: it is regular, full stop.  Second, when a pattern misbehaves, expanding the sugar in your head is often the fastest way to see why.

There is one important exception, and it is worth naming now so you are not surprised later: **backreferences** (`(a+)\1`, "the same text again") genuinely leave the regular languages behind.  Most modern "regex" engines are not, strictly, regular expression engines.  Day 2 returns to this when it looks at what the engine actually does.

## Examples: Building an Identifier Pattern by Hand

Most languages define an identifier as: a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.  Build it up in stages, on paper, before running anything.

| Stage | Pattern | Reasoning |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1. First character, spelled out | `(a\|b\|...\|z\|A\|...\|Z\|_)` | alternation over the whole menu |
| 2. Same thing, as a class | `[a-zA-Z_]` | sugar for stage 1 |
| 3. Later characters, one of them | `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` | digits are now allowed |
| 4. Any number of later characters | `[a-zA-Z0-9_]*` | Kleene star |
| 5. Concatenate | `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` | the finished pattern |

Now do the same for two more token types before you look at the code:

- an **integer literal**: one or more digits
- a **float literal**: digits, a dot, digits

Write each one twice: once in the three primitives only, and once with sugar.  You are about to prove the two versions describe the same language.

## Model 2: Sugar and Primitives Describe the Same Set

This model writes each token pattern both ways and tests them against the same inputs.  If the sugar is really sugar, the two columns must agree on every row.

```python
import re

# Each entry: (name, sugary pattern, the SAME language in bare primitives)
TOKENS = [
    ("integer",
     r"[0-9]+",
     r"(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)*"),

    ("identifier",
     r"[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*",
     # abbreviated menus to keep the line readable; same idea, fewer letters
     r"(a|b|c|_)(a|b|c|_|0|1|2)*"),

    ("float",
     r"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+",
     r"(0|1|2)(0|1|2)*\.(0|1|2)(0|1|2)*"),

    ("optional sign",
     r"-?[0-9]+",
     r"(-|)(0|1|2)(0|1|2)*"),
]

INPUTS = {
    "integer":       ["0", "42", "007", "", "4a", "-7"],
    "identifier":    ["a", "abc", "_a1", "c_2", "1a", "", "a-b"],
    "float":         ["1.2", "10.01", "1.", ".2", "12", "1.2.3"],
    "optional sign": ["1", "-1", "-", "--1", "12", ""],
}

for name, sugar, primitive in TOKENS:
    print(f"\n=== {name} ===")
    print(f"  sugar:     {sugar}")
    print(f"  primitive: {primitive}")
    disagreements = 0
    for s in INPUTS[name]:
        a = bool(re.fullmatch(sugar, s))
        b = bool(re.fullmatch(primitive, s))
        flag = "" if a == b else "   <-- DISAGREE"
        if a != b: disagreements += 1
        print(f"    {s!r:8} sugar={str(a):5} primitive={str(b):5}{flag}")
    print(f"  -> {'identical on every input' if not disagreements else str(disagreements) + ' disagreements'}")

print("\nWhere the two columns disagree, the primitive version has a SMALLER")
print("alphabet (only a,b,c and 0,1,2), not different power. Widen the menus")
print("and the disagreements vanish. Sugar adds no power, only readability.")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Reading the Code

- The `integer` row is the honest one: `[0-9]+` and the fully spelled-out ten-way alternation agree on *every* input, because the primitive version has the full digit menu.
- The `identifier` and `float` rows deliberately shrink the alphabet so the lines stay readable.  Where they disagree, look at *which* input caused it; it will always be a character outside the abbreviated menu, never a structural difference.
- `-?[0-9]+` versus `(-|)...` shows `?` expanding to an alternation with the empty string.  Note that `(-|)` is legal: the right branch of the alternation is $\varepsilon$.
- Nothing here needs `re.search`; `fullmatch` is the set-membership question, which is what "these two patterns denote the same language" means.

> **Watch out!**  `[0-9]+` and `\d+` are *almost* the same thing.  In Python, `\d` matches Unicode decimal digits, which includes characters like the Devanagari digit `४`.  For a lexer, that is usually not what you want, and `[0-9]` says exactly what you mean.  Be deliberate.

### Critical Thinking Questions

5.  `re.fullmatch(r"[0-9]+", "007")` matches.  Is that correct for an *integer literal* in your project language?  If you want to forbid leading zeros, write the pattern.  What did it cost in complexity?
6.  The float pattern rejects `1.` and `.2`.  Some languages accept both.  Amend the pattern to accept them and say what new ambiguity you have introduced with the lexer's other rules.
7.  Expand `[a-c]{2,3}` by hand into the three primitives.  How many alternatives does it become?  Now expand `[a-z]{2,3}` in your head and say why nobody writes patterns this way.
8.  Backreferences let you write `(a+)\1` for "some a's, then the same a's again."  Which language from *Grammars and the Chomsky Hierarchy* does that resemble, and what does its existence tell you about the word "regex" as used by working programmers?

### Try It Yourself

Write the token patterns for a small language, and make the test suite pass.

```python
import re

# TODO: fill in each pattern. These are the actual token classes you will
#       need for your lexer, so keep whatever you write here.
SPEC = {
    "INT":    None,   # one or more digits, no leading zeros unless the number IS 0
    "IDENT":  None,   # letter or underscore, then letters/digits/underscores
    "FLOAT":  None,   # digits, dot, digits (both sides required)
    "OP":     None,   # one of + - * / = < >
}

CASES = {
    "INT":   (["0", "7", "42", "1000"],        ["007", "", "4a", "-1", "1.0"]),
    "IDENT": (["x", "_x", "abc", "a1", "A_9"], ["1a", "", "a-b", "a b"]),
    "FLOAT": (["1.0", "3.14", "0.5"],          ["1", "1.", ".5", "1.2.3"]),
    "OP":    (["+", "-", "*", "/", "=", "<"],  ["++", "", "a", "<="]),
}

for name, pattern in SPEC.items():
    yes, no = CASES[name]
    print(f"\n{name}: {pattern!r}")
    if pattern is None:
        print("  (not written yet)")
        continue
    for s in yes:
        print(f"    {s!r:8} should MATCH     -> "
              f"{'ok' if re.fullmatch(pattern, s) else 'FAILED'}")
    for s in no:
        print(f"    {s!r:8} should NOT match -> "
              f"{'ok' if not re.fullmatch(pattern, s) else 'FAILED'}")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output once all four are written: every line reads `ok`.  `INT` is the hard one, because "no leading zeros unless the number is 0" is an alternation, not a repetition.

# Part III: Regex at the Command Line

You will use regular expressions in two places this semester: inside Python, where you write your lexer, and at the shell, where you search your own source tree.  The Overview assignment asks you to submit a `grep` transcript, and you will reach for it constantly once your interpreter is a few thousand lines and "where do I construct a `BinOp` node?" is a `grep` question rather than a scrolling question.

`grep` prints every **line** of its input that contains a match.  Everything else it does is flags.

## The flags that earn their keep

| Flag | Does | Use it when |
|------|------|-------------|
| `-n` | prefix each match with its line number | almost always; you want to jump there |
| `-r` | recurse into a directory tree | searching a project rather than one file |
| `-i` | ignore case | you are unsure how something was capitalized |
| `-w` | match whole words only | searching `eval` without hitting `evaluate` |
| `-v` | invert: print lines that do **not** match | filtering noise out of a log |
| `-c` | print only the count of matching lines | "how many `TODO`s are left?" |
| `-o` | print only the matched part, not the whole line | harvesting every token name from a file |
| `-l` | print only the filenames that matched | "which files mention `Environment`?" |
| `-E` | use **extended** regex syntax | any pattern with `+`, `?`, `\|`, or `()` |

```bash
grep -rn "def parse_" src/                   # every parse function, with line numbers
grep -rn --include="*.py" "Environment" .    # only Python files
grep -c "TODO" interpreter.py                # how much is left
grep -rnw "eval" src/                        # eval, not evaluate
grep -rnoE "[A-Z]+_[A-Z]+" lexer.py          # harvest SCREAMING_CASE token names
```

## The three operators, at the shell

Everything from Part I works here.  These are the same patterns, aimed at files instead of strings:

```bash
grep -nE "^def "               parser.py    # ^ anchors to the start of the line
grep -nE "return$"             parser.py    # $ anchors to the end
grep -nE "\bnum\b"             lexer.py     # \b is a word boundary: num, not number
grep -nE "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"      lexer.py     # a float literal; note the escaped dot
grep -nE "[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*" lexer.py   # POSIX class: an identifier
```

Two portability notes worth knowing now rather than at 2am.  `\d` and `\w` are **not** POSIX and may not work in every `grep`; the portable spellings are `[0-9]` and `[[:alnum:]_]`.  And `.` still means "any character," so a literal dot needs escaping: `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` matches `3.14`, while `[0-9]+.[0-9]+` would also match `3x14`.

## The one thing that surprises everyone: BRE vs ERE

Plain `grep` uses **POSIX Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)**, where `+`, `?`, `|`, `(` and `)` are *literal characters*.  To get the meanings you know from Python, you must either escape them with a backslash or pass `-E` for **Extended** regular expressions.

| You want | BRE (plain `grep`) | ERE (`grep -E`) | Python `re` |
|---|---|---|---|
| one or more | `a\+` | `a+` | `a+` |
| optional | `a\?` | `a?` | `a?` |
| alternation | `cat\|dog` | `cat\|dog` | `cat\|dog` |
| grouping | `\(ab\)*` | `(ab)*` | `(ab)*` |
| exactly 3 | `a\{3\}` | `a{3}` | `a{3}` |

```bash
grep -n  "TODO\|FIXME" notes.md     # BRE: escaped alternation
grep -nE "TODO|FIXME"   notes.md    # ERE: reads like Python
```

**Just use `-E`.**  The escaping rules in BRE are a historical artifact, and every pattern you write in this course is already in the syntax `-E` expects.  (`egrep` is the same thing under an older name.)

> **Check yourself.**  You run
>
> ```bash
> grep -n "lexer|parser" src/main.py
> ```
>
> and get no output, though the file plainly contains both words.  What went wrong?
>
> Plain `grep` uses BRE, where `|` is a literal character, so it searched for the seven-character string `lexer|parser`.  Use `grep -nE`, or escape it as `lexer\|parser`.

> **Watch out!**  `grep` is line-oriented, so it cannot match a pattern spanning a newline.  When you find yourself wanting that ("find every function whose body contains `raise`"), you have left regular-language territory and you want a parser.  That is the same boundary Day 2 draws between regular expressions and context-free grammars, and it shows up in your tools as well as in your theory.

# Check Your Understanding

Which set does `ab*c` denote?

[(X)] An `a`, then zero or more `b`s, then a `c`
[( )] Zero or more repetitions of `ab`, then a `c`
[( )] An `a`, then a `b`, then zero or more `c`s
[( )] Any string containing `a`, `b`, and `c` in some order

---

`ab|cd` does **not** match `abd`.  Why?

[(X)] Alternation binds loosest, so the pattern means "either `ab` or `cd`" and neither is `abd`
[( )] `|` is a literal character in Python's `re`
[( )] `re.fullmatch` requires the pattern to be anchored
[( )] The pattern is a syntax error

---

`r+` is shorthand for which expression in the three primitives?

[(X)] `r r*`
[( )] `r*`
[( )] `(r | ε)`
[( )] `r r`

---

You run `grep -n "parse_(expr|term)" src/` and get nothing, though both functions exist.  The fix is:

[(X)] Add `-E`; plain grep uses BRE, where `(`, `)` and `|` are literal characters
[( )] Add `-i` to ignore case
[( )] Escape the underscore as `\_`
[( )] Use `-v` to invert the match

---

Adding `{n,m}`, `[a-z]`, `?` and `+` to a regex dialect:

[(X)] Adds convenience but no power; the class of describable languages stays regular
[( )] Moves the dialect up to context-free
[( )] Makes patterns match faster
[( )] Is required in order to describe identifiers

---

# Exercises

**Exercise 1.**  Write a regular expression for a string literal: a double quote, any number of characters that are not double quotes, then a double quote.  Now amend it to allow `\"` inside the string.  What made the second version so much harder, and what does that suggest about hand-writing lexers for string literals?

**Exercise 2.**  Expand `[ab]{1,2}c` fully into the three primitives.  Then write the same pattern for `[a-z]{1,2}c` *without* expanding, and say in one sentence why the shorthand exists.

**Exercise 3.**  For your project's token set, write the full regex specification: every token type with its pattern, in a table.  Mark the pairs where one pattern can match a prefix of another (`<` and `<=`, say) and say which must be tried first.  That ordering is a real bug source in the Lexer assignment.

**Exercise 4.**  Use `grep -rnoE` on any Python project on your machine to harvest every function name defined in it.  Show the command and the first ten lines of output.  Then explain which part of your pattern did the work and which part was there only to anchor it.

**Exercise 5.**  Prove to yourself that `.` needs escaping: run `grep -nE "[0-9]+.[0-9]+"` and `grep -nE "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"` over the same file and show one line that only the first one matches.

# Reflection

In your notebook: a regular expression is a *finite* description of a possibly *infinite* set.  That is a strange and powerful thing, and you already use it every day without remarking on it.

Write a paragraph about another finite description of an infinite set that you rely on: a recipe, a rule, a definition, a piece of notation.  What does the description let you do that listing the members never could?  Then, two sentences: which of the three operators do you think does the most work in that analogy, and why?

# Further Reading

- Allison, Chapter 3 §3.1-3.2, on regular expressions and their equivalence to finite automata.
- Allison, Chapter 4, on the pumping lemma; required for the Regex assignment's Part 4 theory questions, and we work one example in class on Day 2.
- The Python [`re` HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html), which Day 2 works through in five verbs.
- [The Shell for Language Development](https://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS374-Fall2026/Tutorials/ShellForLanguageDev), whose grep appendix goes further than Part III: named capture groups and a full log-triage walkthrough that turns unstructured log lines into structured records.

> **Where the practice went.**  Everything that used to be a second day of this activity, Python's `re` in five verbs, watching the engine backtrack, and the one-pattern scanner, is now the first half of the [Lab: Regex Workshop](https://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS374-Fall2026/Assignments/RegexWorkshop), handed out today.  It is written as a walkthrough: run every cell, then vary it.
