# Sprint Studio and Gallery Walk

This deck serves two class sessions: *Sprint Studio: Sprints 1-2 and Gallery Walk*, then *Sprint Studio: Sprint 3 and Release Hardening*.

Building a programming language in a semester takes the same discipline that shipping any complex software takes.  You have to know exactly where you stand, not where you feel like you stand.  Sprint studio days replace "mostly working" with numbers, and the gallery walk replaces private uncertainty with structured peer review.  Together they help teams find their blind spots before Demo Day instead of during it.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Conduct a structured stand-up by reporting concrete metrics (passing tests, completed AST nodes, known failures) rather than qualitative status assessments
- Calculate sprint velocity from planned versus completed work items and use it to project whether the team will finish on time
- Apply the gallery walk protocol to give and receive structured peer feedback on a language implementation in progress
- Triage feedback into backlog items with owners and dates, prioritized by risk and impact on the final release
- Evaluate your language implementation against a release checklist and identify the highest-risk unfinished pieces

> **Before You Begin:** This activity assumes you can:
> - Describe your team's current sprint goal in one sentence with at least one specific deliverable
> - List three AST node types your interpreter currently handles and one it does not yet handle
> - Read and run a Python script that prints structured output to the terminal
>
> If any of these feel shaky, check in with your team before the stand-up.

Studio days are structured work time for the team language project: a stand-up, focused build time, and, on designated days, the formal gallery walk peer review that feeds your final sprint.  This page is the protocol for every studio day; the gallery walk sections apply on the scheduled walk day.  The protocol picks up where the *Language Design Workshop* kickoff left off: your proposal is now a backlog.  The path for today is **stand-up $\rightarrow$ build $\rightarrow$ gallery walk $\rightarrow$ triage $\rightarrow$ release checklist**.

---

## Directions and Group Roles

Project roles (rotated by sprint) are in effect: Coordinator, Builder(s), Evaluator, and Scribe.  The Scribe maintains today's living document: stand-up notes, all feedback received verbatim, and the triaged backlog the team leaves with.

---

## Session 1: Sprints 1-2 and Gallery Walk

In the first session, work through sections 1 through 4 below: the stand-up, build time, the gallery walk, Model 3 (feedback triage), and the triage session.

---

## 1.  Stand-Up (10 minutes)

Each team gets two minutes at the board to answer exactly four questions:

1. What runs end to end today?  Name the sample programs that pass.
2. What is the riskiest unfinished piece of the sprint?
3. What does the test suite report this week, as a count of passing tests?
4. What do you need from me or from another team?

Say the number.  "Mostly working" is not a status.

---


> **Studio tooling moved:** sprint velocity and the red-green discipline are in [CI and TDD for Interpreters](https://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS374-Fall2026/Tutorials/CITDDForInterpreters).

## 2.  Build Time

Each role has one job during build time.  Builders build the sprint increment.  The Evaluator extends the test suite *ahead of* the features, because a failing test is a specification.  The Scribe keeps `SEMANTICS.md` and the decision log current as choices happen, not after.  The Coordinator defends scope against good ideas that belong in the future-work list.  At the mid-studio checkpoint, the Coordinator confirms aloud that the sprint goal is still achievable, or re-scopes it *now*.

---

## 3.  Gallery Walk Protocol (40 minutes, designated days)

Set up stations.  At each station, a team's language runs live (REPL up, sample programs ready) beside two artifacts: the grammar one-pager and the current test results table.  Half of each team hosts and half walks; swap at the midpoint.

Walkers leave one structured card per station, with exactly three fields:

- **Strength**: one specific thing that works, precisely named ("the error message for an unclosed brace points at the opening brace's line").
- **Question**: one real question the demo raised, ideally about a seam or a semantics decision ("what does your `for` desugar to, and does the loop variable survive?").
- **Risk**: the one thing most likely to fail on Demo Day, stated kindly and concretely.

Hosts demonstrate honestly.  Every station must show at least one known failure case (a program that breaks the parser, a semantics corner still undecided).  A demo that hides its failures is rehearsing a deception, and your `SEMANTICS.md` deserves better.

---

## Model 3: Feedback Triage, Turning Gallery Walk Cards into Backlog

Raw gallery walk feedback is like unprocessed ore: valuable, but unusable until refined.  Triage converts each card into a decision: this gets fixed before Demo Day, this gets disclosed honestly, or this goes on the future-work list.  The middle bucket is the discipline.  Admitting a known limitation in public is mature engineering, and nobody in the room will read it as weakness.

> **Watch out!**  "Disclose" does not mean "hide."  It means you have a rehearsed, candid one-sentence description of the limitation ready for Demo Day.  A question-and-answer session where a known bug surfaces without preparation is much worse than a proactive "our interpreter does not yet handle nested function calls, and here is why that is hard."

The Scribe collects all gallery walk cards and triages them live.  The cell below simulates that triage: it takes each card, classifies it into a bucket, and produces a backlog sorted by priority that you can assign on the spot.

```python
# Gallery walk feedback triage simulator.
# FEEDBACK: list of (team, type, text) where type is "strength"|"question"|"risk"
# Edit FEEDBACK to reflect what your team actually received today.

FEEDBACK = [
    ("Team Amber", "strength", "Error message names the exact line and column for undefined variable"),
    ("Team Amber", "question", "What does the loop variable contain after the while exits?"),
    ("Team Amber", "risk",     "Function with no return statement: silently returns None or crashes?"),

    ("Team Cobalt", "strength", "Niche feature (dice rolls) parses cleanly in three contexts"),
    ("Team Cobalt", "question", "Can you pass a function as an argument to another function?"),
    ("Team Cobalt", "risk",     "REPL does not recover from a parse error - requires restart"),

    ("Team Jade",   "strength", "Sample programs are polished and diverse (five different patterns)"),
    ("Team Jade",   "question", "String equality: == or a separate 'equals' operator?"),
    ("Team Jade",   "risk",     "Nested function calls crash on more than two levels of nesting"),

    ("Instructor",  "question", "Does your scoping rule apply inside while loop bodies?"),
    ("Instructor",  "risk",     "SEMANTICS.md says null returns default-value, but the code raises"),
]

# -- Triage rules --------------------------------------------------------------
# Each "risk" and "question" becomes a backlog item.
# Classify into: FIX (blocks demo), DISCLOSE (acknowledged, out of scope), FUTURE

def triage_item(text):
    """Heuristic classifier - replace with your team's actual judgment."""
    crash_words = ["crash", "restart", "None", "raises", "fails", "breaks"]
    if any(w.lower() in text.lower() for w in crash_words):
        return "FIX"
    scope_words = ["first-class", "pass a function", "nested", "two levels"]
    if any(w.lower() in text.lower() for w in scope_words):
        return "FUTURE"
    return "DISCLOSE"

print("=" * 60)
print("  GALLERY WALK TRIAGE REPORT")
print("=" * 60)
print()

buckets = {"FIX": [], "DISCLOSE": [], "FUTURE": [], "STRENGTH": []}
for team, kind, text in FEEDBACK:
    if kind == "strength":
        buckets["STRENGTH"].append((team, text))
    else:
        bucket = triage_item(text)
        buckets[bucket].append((team, kind, text))

print("  OK STRENGTHS (keep and amplify)")

print()
print("  Scribe: fill in the blanks above and commit BACKLOG.md before end of day.")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Reading the Code

- The triage rules are the whole method.  Every risk and every question becomes a backlog item, and each lands in exactly one of FIX, DISCLOSE, or FUTURE.  Nothing may stay unclassified, because unclassified feedback is feedback that quietly evaporates.
- DISCLOSE is the bucket that makes this mature rather than defensive.  A named, well-worded limitation costs a sentence at Demo Day.  An unnamed one costs your credibility when someone finds it live.
- Strengths are counted but generate no backlog items.  They are there so the walk is worth attending, and so you know which parts of the design not to disturb.

### Try It Yourself

Run the triage on the cards your team actually received today.

```python
# TODO 1: replace this with the REAL cards from your gallery walk.
#         (reviewer, type, text) where type is strength | question | risk
FEEDBACK = [
    ("Team B",     "strength", "Error messages name the line and column"),
    ("Team B",     "risk",     "Parser crashes on an unclosed string literal"),
    ("Team C",     "question", "What happens when you divide by zero?"),
    ("Team C",     "risk",     "SEMANTICS.md says lexical scope, the code does dynamic"),
    ("Instructor", "risk",     "No test covers the while loop"),
    ("Team D",     "strength", "The REPL keeps state between lines"),
    ("Team D",     "question", "Can functions be passed as arguments yet?"),
]

# TODO 2: classify each risk and question yourself. The rule of thumb:
#         FIX      -- breaks the core demo story
#         DISCLOSE -- real, acknowledged, out of scope for this sprint
#         FUTURE   -- report material, not this term's work
CLASSIFICATION = {
    "Parser crashes on an unclosed string literal": "FIX",
    "What happens when you divide by zero?":        "DISCLOSE",
    "SEMANTICS.md says lexical scope, the code does dynamic": "FIX",
    "No test covers the while loop":                "FIX",
    "Can functions be passed as arguments yet?":    "FUTURE",
}

buckets = {"FIX": [], "DISCLOSE": [], "FUTURE": [], "UNCLASSIFIED": []}
strengths = []
for who, kind, text in FEEDBACK:
    if kind == "strength":
        strengths.append((who, text)); continue
    buckets[CLASSIFICATION.get(text, "UNCLASSIFIED")].append((who, text))

print("=== Strengths (no action, but do not disturb these) ===")
for who, text in strengths:
    print("  " + who.ljust(11) + text)

for name in ("FIX", "DISCLOSE", "FUTURE", "UNCLASSIFIED"):
    print("\n=== " + name + " (" + str(len(buckets[name])) + ") ===")
    for who, text in buckets[name]:
        print("  " + who.ljust(11) + text)

print("\n  Backlog items to assign before anyone leaves: " + str(len(buckets["FIX"])))
if buckets["UNCLASSIFIED"]:
    print("  UNCLASSIFIED is not a bucket. Sort these before you close the session.")

# TODO 3: every FIX item needs an owner and a date, today, in the room.
#         Print them as assignable lines and paste into your issue tracker.
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

Expected output: three FIX items, one DISCLOSE, one FUTURE, and an empty UNCLASSIFIED bucket.  If your own run leaves anything unclassified, that is the session's real work.

### Critical Thinking Questions

7.  Two items are classified as DISCLOSE: known limitations acknowledged at Demo Day rather than fixed.  Why is a well-worded disclosure *preferable* to a rushed fix made the night before?  What risks does a rushed fix introduce?
8.  The Instructor's risk item says "SEMANTICS.md says X, but the code does Y." Which one is right?  Write the policy your team will follow when documentation and implementation disagree.
9.  As a walker, you notice a language with much better error messages than yours.  Should you copy their approach, ask how they did it, or note it as a future-work item?  Use the triage categories to articulate the difference.

---

## 4.  Triage (20 minutes, after the walk)

Cluster the cards and sort every item into exactly one bucket: Fix before Demo Day (breaks the core story), Disclose at Demo Day (real, acknowledged, out of scope), or Future work (report material).  The middle bucket is the discipline: mature engineering names its known defects.  The Scribe converts bucket one into assigned, dated backlog items before anyone leaves.

---

## Session 2: Sprint 3 and Release Hardening

In the second session, run the stand-up and build time from sections 1 and 2 again, then work through section 5 below: the Demo Day release checklist.

---

## 5.  Demo Day Release Checklist

Before Demo Day, the Evaluator verifies and signs each line:

1.  The REPL and the file-runner both work from a fresh clone following the readme, in under three minutes.
2.  All sample programs (five minimum, including one that shows off the niche) run with committed expected outputs.
3.  The test suite passes and its results table is current in the repository.
4. `SEMANTICS.md` and the grammar document match what the implementation actually does today.
5.  One failure case is rehearsed and its disclosure worded.
6.  Every teammate can run the demo and explain the distinctive feature solo.
7.  Reproducibility: Python version listed, any dependencies pinned, setup tested by the teammate who did not write it.

The script below turns that checklist into code.  Each check must return True to pass.

```python
# Release checklist automator: enforces the 7-item checklist as code.
# Run this before Demo Day. Each check must return True to pass.

import os, subprocess, sys

def check(label, result, guidance=""):
    status = "OK" if result else "FAIL"
    print(f"  {status}  {label}")
    if not result and guidance:
        print(f"        -> {guidance}")
    return result

print("=" * 55)
print("  DEMO DAY RELEASE CHECKLIST")
print("=" * 55)
print()

results = []

# Check 1: README exists and contains setup instructions
readme_ok = os.path.exists("README.md") or os.path.exists("readme.md")
results.append(check("README exists with setup instructions", readme_ok,
    "Create README.md with: Python version, install steps, 'python main.py' usage"))

# Check 2: sample programs exist
samples = [f for f in os.listdir(".") if f.startswith("sample") and f.endswith(".lang")]
results.append(check(f"Sample programs present ({len(samples)} found, 5 required)",
    len(samples) >= 5,
    "Add sample_01.lang through sample_05.lang; one must show the niche feature"))

# Check 3: test suite file exists
test_file = os.path.exists("test_lang.py") or os.path.exists("tests.py")
results.append(check("Test suite file exists", test_file,
    "Create test_lang.py; run it; commit passing output"))

# Check 4: SEMANTICS.md exists and is non-empty
sem_ok = os.path.exists("SEMANTICS.md") and os.path.getsize("SEMANTICS.md") > 500
results.append(check("SEMANTICS.md exists and is non-trivial (>500 bytes)", sem_ok,
    "Must cover: scoping, truthiness, division, strings, null/absent-value policy"))

# Check 5: grammar file exists
grammar_ok = os.path.exists("grammar.ebnf") or os.path.exists("GRAMMAR.md")
results.append(check("Grammar document present", grammar_ok,
    "grammar.ebnf or GRAMMAR.md must match current implementation"))

# Check 6: main entry point is runnable
entry_ok = os.path.exists("main.py") or os.path.exists("lang.py")
results.append(check("Entry point (main.py or lang.py) exists", entry_ok,
    "python main.py --repl and python main.py program.lang must both work"))

# Check 7: no Python syntax errors in main entry point
if entry_ok:
    entry_file = "main.py" if os.path.exists("main.py") else "lang.py"
    try:
        result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "py_compile", entry_file],
                                capture_output=True)
        syntax_ok = result.returncode == 0
    except Exception:
        syntax_ok = False
    results.append(check(f"Entry point has no Python syntax errors", syntax_ok,
        f"Run: python -m py_compile {entry_file}"))
else:
    results.append(check("Entry point syntax check (skipped: no entry file)", False,
        "Create main.py first"))

print()
passed = sum(results)
total  = len(results)
print(f"  {passed}/{total} checks passed")
if passed == total:
    print("  -> Ready for Demo Day. OK")
elif passed >= total - 1:
    print("  -> One item remaining. Fix it today.")
else:
    print(f"  -> {total - passed} items remaining. Triage them now.")
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

### Critical Thinking Questions

10.  The checklist runs automated checks, but check 6 ("every teammate can demo the distinctive feature solo") cannot be automated.  Why does this check matter, and what would a *passing* version of it look like as an observable event rather than a feeling?
11.  Check 4 requires SEMANTICS.md to be non-trivial (>500 bytes).  Is this a good proxy for "SEMANTICS.md is complete"?  Propose a better automated check.
12.  The checklist is run *before* Demo Day.  On what day should the Evaluator first run it, and what should happen if any check fails with three days remaining?

# Check Your Understanding

Every risk and question from the gallery walk becomes a backlog item sorted into exactly one bucket. The point of forcing a bucket is:

[(X)] Unclassified feedback quietly evaporates; a bucket is a decision, even when the decision is "not now"
[( )] It makes the list shorter
[( )] Only FIX items matter
[( )] It satisfies the rubric

---

DISCLOSE means a limitation is real, acknowledged, and out of scope. It is preferable to a rushed fix because:

[(X)] A fix made the night before is untested and can break the parts of the demo that currently work
[( )] Disclosure takes less time
[( )] Graders penalize late commits
[( )] It moves the problem to the report

---

A reviewer writes "SEMANTICS.md says X but the code does Y." The right first question is:

[(X)] Which one is correct, since the answer decides whether you change the document or the code
[( )] Whether the reviewer read the document carefully
[( )] Whether it blocks the demo
[( )] Whether Y is faster than X

---

The release checklist is written as code that must return True rather than as a list to read. That is because:

[(X)] A check you can run cannot be skipped by a tired team at 2 AM, and it reports the same answer for everyone
[( )] It is faster to execute
[( )] It can be graded automatically
[( )] Lists are hard to read

---

## Reflection Prompt

In your notebook: compare the feedback your team received today with the error messages your language gives its users.  Both are diagnostics offered to someone mid-effort.  What makes each one useful or useless, and what will you change in one of them this week?  Also: the stand-up discipline says "say the number."  What is one domain (not software) where you have benefited from someone insisting on numbers over adjectives?
