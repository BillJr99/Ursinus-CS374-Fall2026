title: "CS374: Principles of Programming Languages - Lab: Environments and Scope"

info:
  coursenum: CS374
  purpose: "To build the Interpreter assignment's Environment class with a partner, covering nested scopes, define versus assign, and shadowing, and to verify it against the exact behaviors the Interpreter's evaluator depends on."
  tilt:
    task: "With a partner, implement an Environment class with parent chaining, distinguish define from assign, and verify shadowing, scope restoration, and name-error behavior against a provided test script."
    criteria: "I grade a correct Environment class that passes all provided behavior tests, and a short trace exercise that predicts scope behavior on paper, weighted 70/30 across the two parts.  The full breakdown is in the rubric below."
  points: 15
  goals:
    - To implement an Environment class with parent chaining supporting nested scopes
    - To distinguish definition (creating a name in the current scope) from assignment (updating the nearest enclosing binding)
    - To verify shadowing, scope restoration, and name-error behavior with tests and paper traces
  rubric:
    - weight: 10
      description: "Part 0: Before You Start - Binding and Scope"
      preemerging: Neither the shadowing trace nor the scoping probes are attempted
      beginning: The let expression is evaluated to an answer but no environment is drawn at any step
      progressing: The environment is drawn at each step and the dynamic-scope prediction is made, but the divergence step is not identified, or only one distinguishing probe program is written
      proficient: let x = 2 in let x = x + 1 in x * x is evaluated with the environment drawn at each step, under both lexical and dynamic scope, with the exact step marked where the two disagree; the unbound-variable behavior is decided with a stated error and timing; and two probe programs are written whose output differs by scoping rule, with a prediction for each under each rule
    - weight: 63
      description: "The Environment Class (Goals 1, 2)"
      preemerging: The class is missing, or lookup does not consult parent scopes
      beginning: Lookup chains to parents but define and assign are conflated, so inner assignment creates shadows instead of updating
      progressing: Define and assign are distinguished and shadowing works, but assignment to an undefined name does not raise a language-level error, or exiting a scope fails to restore the outer binding
      proficient: define creates in the current scope, assign updates the nearest enclosing binding and raises a positioned language-level name error when no binding exists, lookup chains correctly to any depth, shadowing and scope restoration pass every provided test, and the shadowing program prints 51 then 2
    - weight: 27
      description: "Scope Trace Exercise (Goal 3)"
      preemerging: The trace is missing or contradicts the submitted implementation
      beginning: The trace predicts final output only, with no per-step environment states
      progressing: The trace shows environment states per step with one prediction error against the actual run
      proficient: The trace shows the environment chain at every step, every prediction matches the actual run, and the lexical-vs-dynamic question is answered by pointing to the exact line of the class that decides it

In this lab you build `Environment`, the class that makes scope real in your interpreter.  An environment is the data structure that maps variable names to their values.  Each block of code gets its own environment, and each environment points to the enclosing one, so a lookup can walk outward until it finds the name.  The Interpreter assignment's Step 2c imports what you build here unchanged.  By the time you wire it into the evaluator, its behavior should already be settled and tested.  You do this lab with a partner.

**Pair policy.**  You may do this lab in pairs.  You each submit the same files, name each other in them, and earn the same grade.  You may also work alone.  The Interpreter assignment remains individual work: you may both carry this shared `Environment` into it, but the evaluator around it must be your own.

## Part 0: Before You Start - Binding and Scope (10%)

Do this part on paper before you write the `Environment` class.  It has two halves, one for each of the two topics it prepares you for.  You may do it alone even though the rest of this lab is pair work.

Drawing the environment settles a scope question in about thirty seconds.  Two terms first.  Under lexical scope, a name refers to the binding in the enclosing text of the program.  Under dynamic scope, a name refers to the most recent binding made by any caller that is still running.

### Half 1: The Shadowing Trace

1.  Evaluate `let x = 2 in let x = x + 1 in x * x` by hand, drawing the environment at each step.  Shadowing is what happens here: the inner binding of `x` hides the outer one.
2.  Predict the answer under dynamic scope instead of lexical scope.  Mark the exact step where the two rules give different results.
3.  Separately, trace what your evaluator does with an unbound variable, a name that no environment in the chain defines.  Decide what error it should raise and at what moment.

### Half 2: The Mystery Scoping Language

1.  Write two short programs whose output differs depending on whether the language is lexically or dynamically scoped.  Make one of them as short as you can.
2.  For each program, write your prediction of what it prints under each rule.

In class you will run these against an interpreter whose scoping rule is hidden and deduce the rule from the answers.  A probe is worth exactly as much as its ability to tell the two rules apart.

A half-finished trace is worth more than a blank page.  Part 1's distinction between `define` and `assign` is the mechanism that makes your trace come out one way rather than the other.

---

## Part 1: The Environment Class (63%)

Implement `Environment` in `environment.py`.  It stands alone: no AST or evaluator is needed, and its interface is plain Python.

- `Environment(parent=None)`: a scope with an optional enclosing scope.
- `define(name, value)`: create `name` in this scope.  This shadows any outer binding of the same name.
- `assign(name, value)`: update the nearest enclosing binding of `name`.  If no scope in the chain defines it, raise a language-level `LangNameError` (not a bare Python `KeyError`) that carries the name.
- `lookup(name)`: return the nearest enclosing binding's value, or raise `LangNameError`.

Verify your class against the provided behavior script `test_environment.py` in the course starter repo.  It checks five behaviors:

1.  Lookup through three levels of nesting.
2.  `define` in an inner scope shadows the outer binding.
3.  `assign` from an inner scope updates the outer binding.
4.  `assign` to an undefined name raises.
5.  Scope restoration: after a child scope is discarded, the outer binding is unchanged.

The signature behavior to get right is the Interpreter assignment's shadowing program: an inner `let x` shadows the outer one and prints `51`, and after the block exits the outer `x` is intact and prints `2`.

## Part 2: Scope Trace Exercise (27%)

Write your predictions in `trace.md` before you run anything.  The test script comes with a short program of three nested blocks that mix `define` and `assign`.

1.  For each numbered step of that program, draw the environment chain: each scope as a box with its bindings and an arrow to its parent.
2.  Run the program and compare.  For any step where your prediction missed, explain which rule you misapplied.
3.  Close with two theory questions from the Binding and Scope session.  First, which line of your class makes this language lexically scoped rather than dynamically scoped?  Second, re-predict the trace program's final output under dynamic scoping, where the lookup chain follows the callers rather than the enclosing text, and name the step where the two rules first diverge.

## Deliverables

Submit a ZIP containing `environment.py`, the passing `test_environment.py` output (log or screenshot), and `trace.md` with both partners named.

## Grading Breakdown

This lab is worth 15 points, as the course schedule states.  Each part's weight below is a percentage of those 15 points, and the rubric rows use the same percentages.

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Part 0: Binding and Scope | 10% |
| Part 1: The Environment Class | 63% |
| Part 2: Scope Trace Exercise | 27% |
| **Total** | **100% (15 points)** |

## Reflection Prompts

- What is the observable difference, in one example program, between a language where assignment creates bindings and one where it only updates them?
- If you worked in a pair, who did what, and name one thing your partner caught that you would have missed.  If you worked alone, note that instead.
- AI disclosure: list any generative-AI tools you used, for what, and how you verified the results (or state 'none').
- Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this lab (I will not judge you for this at all; I am simply using it to gauge if the labs are too easy or hard)?
