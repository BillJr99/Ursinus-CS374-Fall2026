title: "CS374: Principles of Programming Languages - Functional Programming"

info:
  coursenum: CS374
  purpose: "To build fluency in the functional paradigm.  Everyone completes a shared core (pure functions, higher-order functions, and recursive structures with fold), and then takes one self-chosen direction deeper.  Your team will weigh this paradigm as a design option for its own language."
  tilt:
    task: "Complete the two core parts (pure functions with higher-order combinators, and recursive structures with a generic fold), then choose ONE direction and carry it to depth: closures and lazy generators, CPS and call/cc, Church encodings, combinatory logic, parallel functional programming, declarative logic programming in Prolog, or a scoped open-source contribution to a functional-language ecosystem."
    criteria: "I grade the core on honoring the no-loop and no-assignment constraints and on fully generic tree and list operations (25 points each), and I grade your chosen direction on reaching its stated depth (50 points).  The direction-depth rubric row applies equally to every direction.  The rubric below breaks it down in full."
  points: 100
  goals:
    - To write pure functions and higher-order functions in Python using map, filter, reduce, and recursion without loops or assignment
    - To implement recursive data structures including trees and linked lists with map and fold operations
    - "To take the paradigm shift to depth along one self-chosen direction: closures and lazy generators, continuation-passing style and call/cc, Church encodings, combinatory logic, parallel functional programming, declarative logic programming in Prolog, or a scoped open-source contribution to a functional-language ecosystem"
  rubric:
    - weight: 25
      description: "Core: Pure Functions and Higher-Order Functions (Goal 1: write pure functions and higher-order functions using map, filter, reduce, and recursion without loops or assignment)"
      preemerging: The solutions rely pervasively on loops and assignment, or fail to run due to major errors
      beginning: Most solutions run but several use loops or assignment where the directions forbid them, or combinator usage is incorrect (e.g., map returns a map object that is never consumed)
      progressing: All solutions are correct and respect the no-loop and no-assignment constraints, but combinators are used awkwardly (e.g., reduce used where map would suffice, or lambda where a named function would be clearer)
      proficient: Correct solutions use map, filter, reduce, and recursion idiomatically throughout with no loops or assignment in solution bodies, demonstrating Goal 1; the compose function works for any arity; my_map and my_reduce are property-tested against the built-ins; each function is documented with its type signature and one-sentence description; and the functional theory questions are answered with a correct referential-transparency demonstration and paradigm placements
    - weight: 25
      description: "Core: Recursive Data Structures (Goal 2: implement recursive data structures including trees and linked lists with map and fold operations)"
      preemerging: The tree or linked-list structures are missing, or the recursive cases do not terminate
      beginning: The structures are defined but tree_map or tree_fold is missing, or the linked-list fold does not handle the empty-list base case
      progressing: All structures and operations are implemented correctly for the provided test cases, but the functions are not generic, e.g., tree_fold is hardcoded to addition rather than taking a combining function
      proficient: Both the binary tree and the linked-list structures are defined as dataclasses; tree_map, tree_fold, list_map, and list_fold all take a function argument and work for any operation, demonstrating Goal 2; flatten and depth are implemented in terms of fold; and all operations are tested with at least four inputs including edge cases (empty list, single-node tree)
    - weight: 50
      description: "Direction Depth (Goal 3: carry your chosen direction, closures and lazy generators, CPS and call/cc, Church encodings, combinatory logic, parallel functional programming, declarative logic programming in Prolog, or a scoped open-source contribution to a language ecosystem, to its stated depth)"
      preemerging: "The direction work is absent, or does not use the direction's defining mechanism, e.g., factories that use global state instead of closures, a CPS interpreter whose cases return values directly instead of calling k, encodings that are never reduced, a reducer that cannot contract a single redex, a \"parallel\" map that is sequential, Prolog clauses that never rely on unification/backtracking (e.g., only ground facts, no rules), or an open-source \"contribution\" with no functional-paradigm substance (a typo fix or formatting-only change)"
      beginning: "The direction's defining mechanism is present but one or more of its required components is incorrect or missing, e.g., generators that materialize the whole sequence before yielding, continuations threaded incorrectly through compound expressions, substitution that captures variables on the adversarial tests, combinator rules misapplied, parallel results never verified against the sequential baseline, Prolog solutions that solve some curated problems but omit the bidirectional-relation demonstration or the backtracking enumeration, or an open-source contribution submitted without tests or documentation, or with no maintainer exchange (or documented attempt) recorded"
      progressing: All of the direction's required components work correctly for the provided cases, but items on the direction's depth checklist are incomplete; the demonstrations, measurements, or analyses that turn a working artifact into an argued one
      proficient: Every item on the chosen direction's depth checklist is met, all required components work on provided and edge cases, and the writeup connects the direction back to the core, stating precisely what Parts 1 and 2's pure-function and fold disciplines contributed to the direction work, demonstrating Goal 3 at full depth

This assignment trains you to write Python in the functional style.  Everyone completes the same two-part core: Part 1 is pure functions with higher-order combinators, and Part 2 is recursive data structures with a generic fold.  Then you choose **one direction** and carry it to depth.

The constraints are the content.  Where a part says no loops and no assignment statements inside the solution logic, that rule is what retrains you from imperative thinking (change a variable, step by step) to functional thinking (describe the result as a chain of transformations).  Two terms recur throughout.  A pure function is one whose output depends only on its inputs and which changes nothing outside itself.  A higher-order function is one that takes a function as an argument or returns one.

## The Shape of This Assignment: Core Plus One Direction

This is one assignment with one deliverable and one rubric.  Parts 1 and 2 are the core, worth 25 points each.  Part 3 is your direction, worth 50 points.  Choose exactly one direction:

- **[Direction A: Closures and Lazy Generators](#direction-a-closures-and-lazy-generators)**: function factories that capture behavior, and infinite sequences computed on demand.  This is the most direct continuation of the core, and its techniques (memoization, generator pipelines) are the ones you are most likely to reuse in the team project.
- **[Direction B: Continuation-Passing Style and call/cc](#direction-b-continuation-passing-style-and-callcc)**: transform a small interpreter so that no call ever returns, then capture "the rest of the computation" as a value and rebuild break, exceptions, and generators from it.
- **[Direction C: Church Encodings](#direction-c-church-encodings)**: the untyped lambda calculus in code: capture-avoiding substitution, normal-order reduction, and data (booleans, numerals, pairs) represented as pure behavior.
- **[Direction D: Combinatory Logic, A Flock of Birds](#direction-d-combinatory-logic-a-flock-of-birds)**: computation with no variables at all: a reducer for the S, K, I (and friends) combinators, point-free programming, and the bracket-abstraction translation from lambda terms.
- **[Direction E: Parallel Functional Programming](#direction-e-parallel-functional-programming)**: purity buys parallelism: a MapReduce pipeline over a real corpus, measured and analyzed against Amdahl's Law.  This is the Functional stop on the [music and live-coding path]({{ site.baseurl }}/Projects/TeamLanguage#the-music-and-live-coding-path).
- **[Direction F: Declarative Logic Programming in Prolog](#direction-f-declarative-logic-programming-in-prolog)**: a different paradigm entirely.  You describe *relations that hold* and let a search engine (unification plus backtracking) find the answers, including running the same relation "backwards."  Nothing to install; it runs in the browser.  Choose this if you want the widest possible contrast with the interpreter you just built.
- **[Direction G: Contribute to an Open-Source Language Ecosystem](#direction-g-contribute-to-an-open-source-language-ecosystem)**: take the paradigm public with a scoped, functional-paradigm-relevant contribution to a real open-source project: [mal (Make-a-Lisp)](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) (a step port increment or test-harness improvement), [Strudel](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel)/TidalCycles (a pattern or transformation function, the open-source stop on the [music path]({{ site.baseurl }}/Projects/TeamLanguage#the-music-and-live-coding-path)), a [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar, or [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) documentation and worked examples (pairs naturally with Direction F's material).  You submit it as a real pull request with tests and documentation.  **Requires instructor scope approval within the first week of the assignment.**

Every direction is worth the same 50 points, is graded on the same direction-depth rubric row, and ends in the same deliverable shape: working code, tests, and a writeup section that connects the direction back to the core.  Choose by interest.  None of them is the easy one.

> **Scope note:** this assignment runs alongside your team project's build sprints.  Budget the direction at roughly **6-8 hours** and pick a bounded slice you can finish well; each direction's depth checklist marks the line between "complete" and "extension."  If you completed the Lambda Calculus lab, Direction C is a natural continuation: the lab's by-hand reductions and Church encodings are exactly the behavior your reducer must reproduce in code.

---

## Getting Started

### Environment and Setup

You need Python 3.10 or newer and only the standard library: `functools` (for `reduce`), `dataclasses`, `typing`, and, for Direction E only, `multiprocessing`.  Create the core files up front, plus the file for your chosen direction (its section names the file):

```
higher_order.py           # Part 1
recursive_structures.py   # Part 2
<direction file(s)>       # Part 3: see your direction's section
test_functional.py        # assertions for the core and your direction
```

### Your First 30 Minutes

Start with `total_length` from Step 1a.  It exercises the whole Part 1 toolkit in one line of thinking: `filter` keeps the words longer than three letters, `map` turns each word into its length, and `reduce` (or `sum`) combines the lengths.

```python
from functools import reduce

# total_length: list[str] -> int
def total_length(words):
    return reduce(lambda acc, n: acc + n,
                  map(len, filter(lambda w: len(w) > 3, words)),
                  0)

assert total_length(["hi", "hello", "world", "it"]) == 10
```

Notice what is absent: no loop, no accumulator variable, no assignment.  If you catch yourself reaching for `total = 0` and a `for` loop, that instinct is exactly what this assignment retrains.  Restate the problem as a chain of transformations instead.

### Suggested Pacing

See the course schedule for the assigned and due dates.  If a break falls inside the window, finish Parts 1 and 2 before it so that only the direction work travels with you.  Remember that your team project's sprints run in parallel:

| Checkpoint | You should have |
|------------|----------------|
| On assignment | Part 1 underway: combinators, `compose`, and property-tested `my_map`/`my_reduce`; direction chosen |
| Checkpoint 1 | Part 1 complete (Direction G: scope approval within 3 days of hand-out) |
| Checkpoint 2 | Part 2 complete: tree and linked-list operations with edge-case tests; direction started |
| Midpoint | Direction components working for the provided cases, on your own schedule |
| Checkpoint 3 | Direction depth work underway |
| Due date | Direction depth checklist complete; writeup and ZIP submitted |

## Part 1 (Core): Pure Functions and Higher-Order Functions (25 points)

The constraints for this entire part: no `for` loops, no `while` loops, and no assignment statements (no `=`) inside solution function bodies.  You may use `map`, `filter`, `functools.reduce`, `lambda`, and recursion.  You may use `return`.

### Step 1a: Basic Combinators

Implement and test each function below.  Give each one its type signature as a comment and at least three test assertions.

**`total_length(words: list[str]) -> int`**  
Return the total number of characters across all words longer than three letters.  
Example: `total_length(["hi", "hello", "world", "it"])` -> `10` (hello=5, world=5).

**`product_of_odds(nums: list[int]) -> int`**  
Return the product of all odd numbers.  Define and document the empty-product case: return `1` for the empty list, because 1 is the multiplicative identity.  
Example: `product_of_odds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` -> `15`.

**`longest(words: list[str]) -> str`**  
Return the longest word using a single `reduce`.  On a tie, return the first one encountered (left to right).  Raise `ValueError` if the list is empty.  
Example: `longest(["cat", "elephant", "dog"])` -> `"elephant"`.

**`flatten_once(lists: list[list]) -> list`**  
Flatten one level of nesting using `reduce`.  Do not use `itertools`.  
Example: `flatten_once([[1,2], [3], [4,5]])` -> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Step 1b: Function Composition

**`compose(*fns)`**  
Return a new function that applies the given functions left to right (the first function is applied first).

```python
strip_lower_len = compose(str.strip, str.lower, len)
assert strip_lower_len("  Hello  ") == 5
```

Use `functools.reduce` internally.  Do not use a loop.

Worked example: `compose(f, g, h)(x)` = `h(g(f(x)))`.

### Step 1c: Recursive my_map and my_reduce

Implement `my_map(f, xs)` and `my_reduce(f, xs, seed)` recursively, with no loops and no list comprehensions inside the body.  Each has a base case (the empty list) and a recursive case (do something with the first element, then recurse on the rest):

```python
def my_map(f, xs):
    """Base case: empty list -> []. Recursive: f(head) consed onto my_map(f, tail)."""
    if not xs:
        return []
    return [f(xs[0])] + my_map(f, xs[1:])

def my_reduce(f, xs, seed):
    """Base case: empty list -> seed. Recursive: apply f to seed and head, recurse on tail."""
    if not xs:
        return seed
    return my_reduce(f, xs[1:], f(seed, xs[0]))
```

Property-test both against the built-ins on at least five inputs each.  A property test checks that two implementations agree on many inputs instead of checking one hand-computed answer:

```python
from functools import reduce
test_lists = [[1,2,3], [], [5], [1,2,3,4,5], [-1,0,1]]
for lst in test_lists:
    assert my_map(lambda x: x*2, lst) == list(map(lambda x: x*2, lst))
    assert my_reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, lst, 0) == reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, lst, 0)
print("All my_map and my_reduce properties hold.")
```

### Functional Theory Questions (in your writeup)

Answer three written questions in your writeup.  They draw on the Programming Paradigms and Functional Programming sessions, and I grade them within Part 1's rubric row.

1.  **Referential transparency, demonstrated.**  Define referential transparency in one sentence.  Then take `total_length` above and show that replacing any call with its result preserves the program.  Next, exhibit one small *impure* Python function of your own (one that uses mutation or I/O) where that replacement changes behavior, and name exactly which property broke.
2.  **Paradigm placement.**  Classify each of these as imperative, functional, or declarative, and state which *question* each paradigm makes the programmer answer ("how, step by step?", "what combination of transformations?", "what result?"):
   - `total = 0` / `for n in nums: total += n`
   - `reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, nums, 0)`
   - `SELECT SUM(n) FROM nums;`
3.  **Purity's price.**  Name one thing your Part 1 constraints (no loops, no assignment) made harder, and one thing they made automatic (testing, reasoning, or parallelism).  Tie each to a property of pure functions rather than to taste.

---

## Part 2 (Core): Recursive Data Structures (25 points)

Both structures in this part are recursive: a tree contains smaller trees, and a list contains a smaller list.  A fold is the one operation that visits the whole structure and combines what it finds, and you will define the other operations in terms of it.

### Binary Tree

Define a `BTree` dataclass with `Optional` left and right children:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional, Any

@dataclass
class BTree:
    value: Any
    left: Optional['BTree'] = None
    right: Optional['BTree'] = None
```

**`tree_map(f, tree: Optional[BTree]) -> Optional[BTree]`**  
Apply `f` to every node's value and return a new tree with the same structure.  Do not modify the original tree (this is a pure function).  
Example: `tree_map(lambda x: x*2, BTree(1, BTree(2), BTree(3)))` -> `BTree(2, BTree(4), BTree(6))`.

**`tree_fold(f, tree: Optional[BTree], seed)`**  
Reduce the tree to a single value by applying `f(left_result, value, right_result)` at each node.  For a `None` node, return `seed`.  
Example: with `f = lambda l, v, r: l + v + r` and seed `0`, the fold computes the sum of all node values.

**`tree_depth(tree: Optional[BTree]) -> int`**  
Implement in terms of `tree_fold`.  The depth of `None` is `0`; the depth of a leaf is `1`.

**`tree_flatten(tree: Optional[BTree]) -> list`**  
Return all node values in in-order traversal (left, root, right), implemented using `tree_fold`.

**Test trees to use:**
- Empty: `None` -> all functions return seed/identity value
- Single node: `BTree(42)` -> map doubles it, fold sums it, depth is 1
- Full tree: `BTree(1, BTree(2, BTree(4), BTree(5)), BTree(3))`
- Right-skewed: `BTree(1, None, BTree(2, None, BTree(3)))`

### Linked List

Define a linked-list type:

```python
@dataclass
class LLNode:
    head: Any
    tail: Optional['LLNode'] = None  # None represents the empty list
```

**`list_map(f, node: Optional[LLNode]) -> Optional[LLNode]`**  
Apply `f` to every element and return a new linked list.

**`list_fold(f, node: Optional[LLNode], seed)`**  
Left fold: accumulate from left to right.  
Example: `list_fold(lambda acc, x: acc + x, LLNode(1, LLNode(2, LLNode(3))), 0)` -> `6`.

**`list_to_python(node: Optional[LLNode]) -> list`**  
Convert to a Python list, implemented via `list_fold`.

**`list_from_python(lst: list) -> Optional[LLNode]`**  
Convert from a Python list to a linked list, implemented via `my_reduce` from Part 1 (no loops).

## Part 3: Your Direction (50 points, choose exactly one)

## Direction A: Closures and Lazy Generators

*Files: `closures.py`, `generators.py`.*

> **Scheduling note:** the Closures class material falls early in this assignment's window (see the course schedule), early enough for Direction A students to lean on it.  Read ahead in that activity if you want to start sooner.

### A.1: Closures and Function Factories

A closure is a function that captures variables from the scope where it was created.  When a factory function creates and returns an inner function, the inner function keeps access to the factory's local variables even after the factory has returned.  Many design patterns are closures in disguise.

**Simple factories.**

**`make_adder(n: int) -> Callable`**: return a function that adds `n` to its argument.  Each call to `make_adder` must produce an independent function.

```python
add5 = make_adder(5)
add10 = make_adder(10)
assert add5(3) == 8
assert add10(3) == 13
assert add5(add10(0)) == 15
```

**`make_multiplier(n: int) -> Callable`**: return a function that multiplies its argument by `n`.

**`make_between(lo: int, hi: int) -> Callable`**: return a predicate that tests whether its argument is in the closed interval `[lo, hi]`.

```python
is_teen = make_between(13, 19)
assert is_teen(15) == True
assert is_teen(20) == False
```

**Stateful closures.**

**`make_counter(start: int = 0) -> Callable`**: return a function that, on each call, returns the next integer starting from `start`.  Each counter is independent.

```python
c1 = make_counter()
c2 = make_counter(10)
assert c1() == 0
assert c1() == 1
assert c2() == 10
assert c1() == 2   # c1 and c2 do not share state
```

Hint: store the state in a mutable default argument or a list.  Python's `nonlocal` also works, but a list demonstrates the capture directly.

**`make_once(f: Callable) -> Callable`**: return a wrapper that calls `f` at most once, caches the first result, and returns that cached result on every later call.

**Memoization.**

**`memoize(f: Callable) -> Callable`**: return a wrapped version of `f` that caches return values by argument in a dictionary.  It must work for any hashable arguments.  Demonstrate the decorator form:

```python
@memoize
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1: return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

assert fib(30) == 832040
```

In your writeup, draw an ASCII diagram (or describe in prose) showing what each closure returned by `make_adder(5)` and `make_adder(10)` captures internally, and why the two closures do not share state.

### A.2: Lazy Sequences with Generators

Strict (eager) evaluation computes every element of a sequence immediately.  Lazy evaluation computes an element only when someone asks for it.  Laziness matters for infinite sequences, which cannot fit in memory, and for pipelines that stop early and so skip the remaining work.

**Infinite generators.**  `naturals(start=0)` yields `start, start+1, ...` forever; `fibonacci()` yields `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` forever.  Both must run indefinitely in O(1) extra memory.  Never call `list()` on them.

**Sequence utilities.**  `take(n, it)` consumes the first `n` elements of any iterator and returns them as a list.  `gen_map(f, it)` lazily applies `f` element by element.  `gen_filter(pred, it)` lazily yields only the elements that satisfy `pred`.

```python
assert take(5, naturals()) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
assert take(5, gen_map(lambda x: x**2, naturals(1))) == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
assert take(5, gen_filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, naturals())) == [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Lazy pipeline.**  Compute the first 10 perfect squares that are also even, using only `gen_map`, `gen_filter`, `naturals`, and `take`.  No list comprehensions and no intermediate lists:

```python
result = take(
    10,
    gen_filter(
        lambda x: x % 2 == 0,
        gen_map(lambda x: x**2, naturals(1))
    )
)
assert result == [4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144, 196, 256, 324, 400]
```

**Strict vs. lazy comparison.**  Find the first Fibonacci number greater than 1000 two ways: first by materializing a large list, then lazily one element at a time.  Time both with `time.perf_counter()`.

### Direction A depth checklist

- All five factories (`make_adder`, `make_multiplier`, `make_between`, `make_counter`, `make_once`) plus `memoize` are correct, with independence between factory instances tested; `memoize` handles any hashable arguments and is demonstrated as a decorator.
- All five generator functions are implemented with `yield`; infinite sequences are demonstrated without hanging; the lazy pipeline runs without intermediate lists.
- The strict-vs-lazy comparison demonstrates a concrete performance difference, and the writeup explains what would happen if `naturals()` used a list instead of `yield`, and why that makes the pipeline impossible to run.
- The closure-capture diagram appears in the writeup.

## Direction B: Continuation-Passing Style and call/cc

*File: `continuations.py`.*

In a direct-style interpreter, every recursive call returns a value, and that value waits on the Python call stack until the caller finishes with it.  In continuation-passing style (CPS), no call ever returns.  Every call receives one extra argument, the continuation `k`: a function that represents "what to do next with the result."  Instead of returning a value, the call passes its value to `k`.  Because calling `k` is the last thing each call does, every call is a tail call, and a trampoline (a loop that runs one step at a time) can execute it in constant stack space.  Once continuations are values, capturing the current one gives you `call/cc` ("call with current continuation"), and from `call/cc` you can rebuild break, exceptions, and generators.  That is why `call/cc` is called *the mother of all control structures*.

### B.1: The CPS transform

Start from a small direct-style interpreter: a miniature of the one you built in the Interpreter assignment, with dataclass AST nodes `Num`, `Bool`, `Var`, `BinOp`, `If`, `Let`, `Lam`, `App`, an `Env` chain, and a `Closure` value.  Write it first (it is under sixty lines; reuse your Interpreter assignment's structure).  Smoke-test it on `(λx. x + 1)(41)` -> `42.0` and `let y = 10 in y * y` -> `100.0` before you change anything.  Then transform `interp(expr, env)` into `interp_k(expr, env, k)`.  The mechanical rule:

> Wherever direct style writes `return f(x)`, CPS writes `f_k(x, env, k)`.  
> Wherever direct style writes `v = f(x); use(v)`, CPS writes `f_k(x, env, lambda v: use_k(v, env, k))`.

Case by case: `Num`, `Bool`, and `Lam` pass their value (or closure) straight to `k`.  `BinOp` evaluates the left operand, then *inside its continuation* evaluates the right operand, then applies the operator and calls the outer `k`.  `If` chooses the branch inside the condition's continuation.  `Let` and `App` chain the same way.  No case may return a value directly.

**Verify equivalence:** for every test expression, `interp_k(e, env, lambda v: v)` must equal `interp(e, env)`.  Cover at least `Num`, `BinOp` (nested), `If` (both branches), `Let`, and `App`.

### B.2: Trampolining

Python does not optimize tail calls, so deep recursion still overflows the stack.  Wrap every tail call in a zero-argument `Thunk` and drive execution with a loop:

```python
class Thunk:
    def __init__(self, f): self.f = f

def trampoline(result):
    while isinstance(result, Thunk):
        result = result.f()
    return result
```

Verify with a chain of 2,000 nested `Let` bindings (comfortably past Python's default recursion limit) that evaluates to the right answer.

### B.3: call/cc

Add a `Callcc(fun)` AST node.  In the CPS interpreter, the current continuation is *exactly* the `k` in hand.  Wrap it in a `Continuation` object that, when called, raises a `ContinuationEscape` carrying the value; the top-level `run` driver catches the escape and resumes.  Demonstrate each of the following as a hand-built AST run through `run`:

1. `call/cc` whose function ignores the continuation behaves as a normal call: `Callcc(Lam("k", Num(42)))` -> `42`.
2.  Invoking the continuation escapes immediately: `Callcc(Lam("k", App(Var("k"), Num(7))))` -> `7`.
3.  After an escape, pending computation is discarded: bind `call/cc(λk. k(5))` in a `Let` whose body multiplies by 1000, and document which value your implementation produces and why.

### B.4: One control structure from scratch

Using the two-continuation pattern (a normal-return `k` and an escape `k`), implement **either** `for_until` **or** `with_handler`.  `for_until` is break as a continuation: iterate a body that may call `break_fn(v)` to exit with `v`.  `with_handler` is exceptions as continuations: `raise_fn` is simply "call the handler's continuation," and it must propagate correctly through nested handlers.  Test the one you build, including the nested case.

### Direction B depth checklist

- CPS equivalence tests pass across at least four expression types, and every `interp_k` case ends in a call to `k` (state this invariant in a comment and explain why each recursive call is now a tail call).
- The trampolined interpreter survives the 2,000-deep `Let` chain.
- All three `call/cc` demonstrations produce their specified results, with escape verified across more than one nesting depth.
- The derived control structure (`for_until` or `with_handler`) works including its nested/propagation case.
- The writeup defines a continuation in one sentence, explains the "mother of all control structures" claim with one concrete example, and maps Python's `try/except`, generators, and `async/await` to the continuation model in a three-row table (naming the restriction that makes each a special case).

## Direction C: Church Encodings

*File: `lambda_calc.py`.*

The untyped lambda calculus has three constructs (variables, abstraction, application), and it can compute anything computable.  This direction builds the calculus in code and then demonstrates its most striking consequence: data can be represented as pure behavior.  A Church boolean *is* the act of choosing between two things.  A Church numeral *is* the act of repeating a function some number of times.  Your Part 1 combinators and Part 2 folds were this same idea in Python dress.

### C.1: The calculus in code

Implement an AST (`LVar`, `LLam`, `LApp` dataclasses) and a `free_vars(term)` function.  Then implement **capture-avoiding substitution**: substitution replaces a free variable with a term, and it is capture-avoiding when it never lets a free variable of the replacement become accidentally bound under a binder.  Follow the standard three-case definition exactly, including the fresh-variable renaming case when substituting under a binder whose variable appears free in the replacement.  Next, implement a single-step normal-order reducer (leftmost-outermost redex first) and a driver `normalize(term, max_steps)` that reduces to normal form under a configurable step limit, with an optional step-by-step trace.

**Adversarial substitution tests**: your substitution must pass these capture traps, and your writeup must display them:

- $$(\lambda y.\, x)[x := y]$$: naive substitution captures $$y$$; correct substitution renames the binder first.
- $$(\lambda y.\, x\ y)[x := y\ z]$$: the same trap, one level deeper.
- One trap of your own design that defeats a substitution function lacking the fresh-variable case.  Show the wrong answer naive substitution produces.

### C.2: The encodings

Encode each of the following as terms in your AST, and verify them mechanically through your reducer:

- **Booleans:** `TRUE = λt.λf.t`, `FALSE = λt.λf.f`, with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `IF`.  Verify that the full truth tables reduce correctly.
- **Numerals:** $$\overline{0}$$ through $$\overline{4}$$, with `SUCC`, `ADD`, and `MUL`.  Verify that `ADD 2 2` and `MUL 2 2` both reduce to terms alpha-equivalent to $$\overline{4}$$.  Two terms are alpha-equivalent when they differ only in the names of bound variables; you will need a small alpha-equivalence checker, so write one.
- **Pairs:** `PAIR`, `FST`, `SND`.  Verify that `FST (PAIR a b)` reduces to `a` and `SND (PAIR a b)` to `b`.

Present the verification as a test table that maps each law to a passing reduction.

### C.3: Strategy and divergence

Implement applicative-order reduction (arguments first) behind the same interface, and demonstrate the term where the two strategies behave differently: $$(\lambda x.\, \lambda y.\, y)\ \Omega$$, where $$\Omega = (\lambda x.\, x\ x)(\lambda x.\, x\ x)$$.  Normal order discards $$\Omega$$ unevaluated and terminates.  Applicative order runs forever, and your step limit fires.  Write one sentence on what each strategy does and why, and one more connecting this to why a lazy language can pass an infinite structure to a function that ignores it.

### Direction C depth checklist

- Substitution passes all three adversarial capture traps, with the naive wrong answer exhibited for your own trap.
- Both reduction strategies work behind a common interface, with the step limit and trace verbosity configurable, and the $$\Omega$$ divergence demonstrated (graceful step-limit report, not a crash).
- All encoding laws are verified mechanically, including `MUL 2 2` up to alpha-equivalence via your checker, presented as a law-to-reduction test table.
- One derivation (your choice) is worked by hand in the writeup, one reduction per line with the contracted redex marked, and cross-checked step-for-step against the interpreter's trace, reconciling any disagreement (finding your own mistake is worth more than not reporting one).
- The writeup answers: where in `map`/`filter`/`reduce` from Part 1 have you already been treating behavior as data, and where in a modern language have Church-style encodings earned their keep?

## Direction D: Combinatory Logic, A Flock of Birds

*Files: `birds.py`, `bracket.py`, `config.json`.*

Combinatory logic strips the lambda calculus down further: no variables, no binding, no substitution.  Only application remains, plus a small fixed set of primitive combinators, each named (after Raymond Smullyan's puzzle book) for a bird.  With only application and the birds, composition, argument passing, and currying are your only tools, and that discipline reshapes how you think about higher-order programming.  The rules:

$$
\mathbf{I}\ a \Rightarrow a \qquad
\mathbf{K}\ a\ b \Rightarrow a \qquad
\mathbf{S}\ f\ g\ x \Rightarrow f\ x\ (g\ x)
$$
$$
\mathbf{B}\ f\ g\ x \Rightarrow f\ (g\ x) \qquad
\mathbf{C}\ f\ a\ b \Rightarrow f\ b\ a \qquad
\mathbf{W}\ f\ x \Rightarrow f\ x\ x \qquad
\mathbf{M}\ x \Rightarrow x\ x
$$

### D.1: Hand reductions

Reduce each term to normal form, one rule per line, naming the rule that fires at each step:

**(a)** $$\mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{I}\ a\ b$$: identify which standard function this is.  **(b)** $$\mathbf{S}\ \mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{K}\ 42$$: what well-known combinator is $$\mathbf{S}\ \mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{K}$$? **(c)** $$\mathbf{B}\ f\ (\mathbf{B}\ g\ h)\ x$$ and $$\mathbf{B}\ (\mathbf{B}\ f\ g)\ h\ x$$: confirm both produce $$f\ (g\ (h\ x))$$, which is associativity of composition.  **(d)** $$\mathbf{C}\ (\mathbf{B}\ f\ g)\ a\ b$$: what two-argument function is $$\mathbf{C}\ (\mathbf{B}\ f\ g)$$? **(e)** $$\mathbf{S}\ (\mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{S})\ \mathbf{K}\ f\ g\ x$$: reduce fully and identify the result as one of the named birds.

### D.2: The combinator reducer

Represent terms as `Prim(name)` and `App(rator, rand)`.  Application is left-associative, so `S K K` is `App(App(Prim("S"), Prim("K")), Prim("K"))`.  Implement outermost-first reduction (the analog of normal order) as the default, with innermost-first selectable via `config.json` alongside `max_steps` (default 1000) and `trace`.  If no normal form is reached within the step limit, print a location-prefixed diagnostic and stop; do not crash.  Verify on: $$\mathbf{I}\ 42$$, $$\mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{I}\ a\ b$$, $$\mathbf{S}\ \mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{K}\ x$$, $$\mathbf{B}\ f\ g\ x$$, and the diverging $$\mathbf{M}\ \mathbf{M}$$.

### D.3: Point-free programming

Point-free style defines a function without naming its arguments: no `lambda`, no `def`, and no named parameters in the definition itself.  Using the birds as Python callables, implement each of the following in point-free style, state its combinator expression beside the Python, and demonstrate it on at least three inputs:

1. `double_then_negate`: double, then negate.
2. `apply_twice(f)`: apply `f` twice.  (Which bird duplicates?)
3. `swap_args(f)`: swap a curried two-argument function's arguments.  (One bird does exactly this.)
4. `on(f, g)`: `on(f, g)(a)(b) = f(g(a))(g(b))`.  (The Psi bird.)
5. `const_function(x)`: ignore the argument, always return `x`.  (The pure Kestrel.)

### D.4: Bracket abstraction

Bracket abstraction translates a lambda term into an SKI expression.  Implement the translation from lambda terms (`LamVar`, `LamAbs`, `LamApp`) via the three rules:

$$
[x]\, x = \mathbf{I} \qquad
[x]\, e = \mathbf{K}\, e \;\; (x \notin \mathrm{FV}(e)) \qquad
[x]\, (e_1\ e_2) = \mathbf{S}\, ([x]\, e_1)\, ([x]\, e_2)
$$

Apply the rules for every lambda, outermost first, until no lambdas remain.  Verify by reducing the translations of $$\lambda x.\ x$$, $$\lambda f.\ \lambda x.\ f\ x$$, and $$\lambda x.\ \lambda y.\ x$$ through your reducer and confirming they behave as identity, function-identity, and Kestrel.  Measure the size (node count) of the SKI translation of $$\lambda x.\ \lambda y.\ x\ y$$ against the original term and comment on the expansion ratio.  This blowup is why real combinator compilers (Turner's algorithm) optimize the translation.

### Direction D depth checklist

- All hand reductions are correct, one rule per line with rule names, and where multiple redexes were available the choice is noted with a remark that confluence held.
- The reducer supports all seven birds with a selectable strategy, a firing step limit on $$\mathbf{M}\ \mathbf{M}$$ (graceful, location-prefixed), and a trace mode showing each step.
- All five point-free functions are correct and tested, each with its combinator expression stated; a sixth of your own design is included with a motivation.
- The bracket-abstraction translator passes all three verifications *through the reducer*, and the size analysis appears in the writeup.
- The writeup answers: how does $$\mathbf{S}\ f\ g\ x = f\ x\ (g\ x)$$ do the job your interpreter's environment does (distributing a value to everywhere it is needed) without any environment at all?

## Direction E: Parallel Functional Programming

*Files: `pipeline.py`, plus your corpus.*

The Google MapReduce paper (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) opens with one observation.  When you write a computation as a pure map over independent inputs followed by an associative reduce over the results, the framework can parallelize it for you.  You never coordinate threads, and you never write a lock.  (A reduce is associative when grouping does not matter: merging `a` with `b` and then with `c` gives the same result as merging `a` with the merge of `b` and `c`.)  This direction tests the functional paradigm's central promise, *purity buys parallelism*, on a real corpus with real measurements, and confronts the practical limit (Amdahl's Law) that constrains real distributed systems.

This is the Functional stop on the [music and live-coding path]({{ site.baseurl }}/Projects/TeamLanguage#the-music-and-live-coding-path).  The same pure-map, associative-reduce discipline is how pattern engines like Strudel evaluate independent events, so students on that path may analyze a corpus of timed-event listings as their dataset instead.  The pipeline requirements are identical.

**Dataset:** the Project Gutenberg plain-text *Moby Dick* (approximately 21,000 lines), split into lines; each line is one "document."

### E.1: The sequential baseline

Implement and test three functions.  `word_frequencies(line) -> dict[str, int]` is your map function; argue in writing that it is pure (no global reads, no shared mutation, and the same output for the same input every time).  `merge_counts(a, b) -> dict` is your reduce function; argue that it is pure *and associative*, and say why associativity matters for parallelism.  `top_n(counts, n)` returns the most frequent words.  Run the sequential pipeline and report total words, unique words, the top 20, and the runtime.

### E.2: The parallel map

Replace `map(word_frequencies, lines)` with `multiprocessing.Pool.map`.  The function must be module-level so that Python can pickle it (serialize it to send to another process).  Assert that the parallel result equals the sequential result.  Then measure wall-clock time (`timeit`, five runs per configuration, report the mean) across worker counts 1, 2, 4, and the maximum available, and across chunk sizes (default, 10, 100, 1000) at maximum workers.  Tabulate time, speedup, and efficiency ($$= \text{speedup} / \text{workers}$$) for every configuration.  At what worker count does efficiency drop below 0.8, and why?  What effect does chunk size have, and why?

### E.3: Tree-reduce

The sequential `reduce(merge_counts, results, {})` performs $$O(n)$$ merges one after another.  Implement `tree_reduce(merge_fn, results)`: pair up adjacent elements, merge the pairs in parallel via `Pool.map`, and repeat until one element remains (carry an odd element forward).  Verify that it matches the sequential reduce, then measure and compare both on the full corpus.  In your writeup, draw the dependency graph of a tree-reduce over 8 elements: how many rounds are there, what is the maximum speedup regardless of core count, and how does the synchronization between rounds relate to the serial fraction below?

### E.4: Amdahl's Law analysis

If a fraction $$f$$ of the computation is serial, the maximum speedup with $$n$$ processors is

$$
S(n) = \frac{1}{f + \frac{1-f}{n}} \;\xrightarrow{\,n \to \infty\,}\; \frac{1}{f}
$$

From your measured data, estimate $$f$$ (using $$f \approx \frac{1/S_{\text{max}} - 1/n_{\text{max}}}{1 - 1/n_{\text{max}}}$$), compute the theoretical maximum speedup, and compare it to what you measured.  Explain the discrepancies (process spawn cost, pickling for inter-process communication, the final sort, OS scheduling).  What speedup would 100 workers give, and what does that imply about this pipeline at datacenter scale?

### Direction E depth checklist

- The map function's purity and the reduce function's purity *and associativity* are argued in writing, and the parallel results are asserted equal to the sequential baseline.
- Timing uses at least five runs per configuration; the full time/speedup/efficiency table covers all worker counts and chunk sizes, with the chunk-size effect explained.
- The tree-reduce works (including the odd-element and empty/single-document edge cases), is measured against the sequential reduce, and its dependency-graph analysis appears in the writeup.
- The Amdahl analysis estimates $$f$$ from measured data, computes the theoretical bound, reconciles it with measurement, and projects to 100 workers.  Your machine's CPU model and core count are stated prominently; speedup numbers are meaningless without them.
- The writeup constructs one hypothetical *non*-associative reduce function and shows how tree-reduce would produce wrong results with it, connecting associativity back to Part 2's folds.

## Direction F: Declarative Logic Programming in Prolog

*File: `logic.pl` (your Prolog source), plus `logic_session.md` (queries and results).  No Python for this direction.*

Every other direction in this assignment, and the entire pipeline before it, is a story about *evaluation*: you write an expression, and a machine reduces it to a value.  Logic programming tells a different story.  In Prolog you state relations that hold (facts and rules) and then pose a query.  The engine searches for every way to make the query true, using unification (two-way pattern matching, the same idea your parser's AST equality hinted at) and backtracking (undoing a choice that failed and trying the next one).  There is no "call and return."  A relation like `append/3` can concatenate two lists, split a list every possible way, or check membership: the same clause, run in any direction.  This is the widest paradigm contrast the course offers, and it directly motivates the microKanren-style relational ideas and the unification you met in the type-checking direction of the Interpreter.

You will work entirely in the browser with [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/) (SWI-Prolog online); there is nothing to install.  Before you start, read the opening chapters of [The Power of Prolog](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog) (Markus Triska's free, modern text) for facts, rules, queries, lists, and how backtracking works.

### F.1: Relational thinking, facts, rules, and queries

Warm up by defining a tiny knowledge base.  Family relations are traditional: `parent/2` facts, then `grandparent/2`, `sibling/2`, and `ancestor/2` rules.  In `logic_session.md`, show at least: one query with a single answer, one query that yields *multiple* answers on backtracking (press `;` in SWISH), and one recursive rule (`ancestor/2`) with a query that requires several backtracking steps.  Explain in one or two sentences what "the engine searches for a proof" means here versus "the evaluator computes a value" in your interpreter.

### F.2: A curated set of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems

Solve the following six problems from the classic [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/99) list.  I chose them to span list recursion, structural recursion, arithmetic, logic, and constraint search; this is a deliberately small, meaningful slice, not the full ninety-nine:

1.  **P01 `my_last(X, List)`**: the last element of a list (basic list recursion).
2.  **P05 `rev(List, Reversed)`**: reverse a list (accumulator recursion).
3.  **P07 `my_flatten(List, Flat)`**: flatten a nested list structure (recursion over term structure).
4.  **P31 `is_prime(N)`**: primality (arithmetic and the `\+`/negation-as-failure you should explain).
5.  **P46 `table(A, B, Expr)`**: print the truth table of a logical expression in `A` and `B` (logic connectives as relations).
6.  **P90 `queens(Qs)`**: place eight non-attacking queens (backtracking search, the payoff problem, where the declarative style shines).

For each problem, include the clause(s) in `logic.pl` and, in `logic_session.md`, the query you ran with its answer(s).  Where a problem admits multiple solutions (P90), show that Prolog enumerates them on backtracking and count how many exist.

### F.3: Run it backwards (the bidirectional relation)

Pick one relation you wrote (or `append/3`) and demonstrate it in at least two modes: for example, `append([1,2],[3],Xs)` (concatenate) *and* `append(Xs, Ys, [1,2,3])` (enumerate every split).  Explain in your writeup why a Python function *cannot* be run backwards like this, and what property of Prolog (unification over logic variables, not evaluation of expressions) makes it possible.  This is the single most important idea in the direction.

### F.4: Unification and backtracking vs. your interpreter's environments

Close with a short written comparison.  This is required, and it is what ties the direction back to the pipeline.  Your interpreter's `Environment` maps names to *values* by assignment, in one direction only, and evaluation never "undoes" a binding.  Prolog's unification binds logic variables to *terms* in both directions, and backtracking un-binds them when a branch fails.  In one paragraph, contrast (a) binding-by-assignment vs. binding-by-unification, and (b) your evaluator's single forward pass vs. Prolog's search-with-backtracking.  If you took the type-checking direction of the Interpreter, connect this explicitly to the unification in your type inferencer; it is the *same* algorithm doing a different job.

### Direction F depth checklist

- The warm-up knowledge base demonstrates a single-answer query, a multi-answer (backtracking) query, and a recursive rule, with the proof-search-vs-evaluation distinction stated.
- All six curated problems (P01, P05, P07, P31, P46, P90) are solved with correct clauses and shown queries/answers; P90's multiple solutions are enumerated and counted; negation-as-failure in P31 is explained.
- One relation is demonstrated running in at least two modes, with a written explanation of why unification (not evaluation) makes bidirectionality possible.
- The F.4 comparison contrasts assignment-binding vs. unification-binding and forward evaluation vs. backtracking search, connecting to the interpreter (and, if applicable, to HM type-inference unification).
- `logic.pl` loads cleanly in SWISH and `logic_session.md` records every query and its output.

## Direction G: Contribute to an Open-Source Language Ecosystem

*Files: `contribution.md` (the contribution log described below), plus a link to your public pull request.  Scope approval from the instructor is required within 3 days of hand-out.*

Every other direction builds something new inside the course.  This one takes the paradigm into a codebase that predates you and will outlive the semester.  You will find a scoped, functional-paradigm-relevant piece of work in a real open-source language ecosystem, specify it with a failing test before you write the fix (the same failing-test-as-specification discipline the whole course runs on), and carry it through a public pull request and a maintainer exchange.  The paradigm content is the same as in the other directions: pure transformations, recursion over structure, functions as values.  The added content is the professional practice around it, and the result is a portfolio line few undergraduates have: *my code was reviewed by the maintainers of a real project.*

**Choosing a target.**  Approved ecosystems, with the kind of contribution that fits each:

- **[mal: Make-a-Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal)**: an increment to a step implementation in a language of your choice, or an improvement to the shared test harness.  mal's whole structure is fold-and-recursion over expression trees, the paradigm at full strength.
- **[Strudel](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel) / TidalCycles**: a pattern or transformation function.  Pattern combinators *are* higher-order functions over timed event structures.  This is the open-source stop on the [music and live-coding path]({{ site.baseurl }}/Projects/TeamLanguage#the-music-and-live-coding-path).
- **[tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammars**: a grammar fix or improvement with its test cases.  This is structural recursion over syntax, adjacent to everything you built this semester.
- **[SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)**: documentation with worked examples, or test cases for library predicates.  It pairs naturally with Direction F's material, and documentation contributions are how most successful open-source careers start.

Something else you care about is negotiable; bring it to the scope-approval conversation.  Two things are not negotiable: the work must have functional-paradigm substance (a typo fix or formatting change does not qualify), and it must be small enough to finish.  One well-scoped, well-tested contribution beats an ambitious abandoned one.

### G.1: Issue selection and scope approval (first 3 days)

Find your target: a triaged open issue, a gap in the documentation, a missing test, or a small feature request with maintainer interest.  In `contribution.md`, record the issue or gap (with links), why it is *functional-paradigm* work (which core ideas from Parts 1 and 2 it exercises), and your one-sentence minimum viable scope.  Bring this to me for approval within 3 days of hand-out.  The approval exists to protect you from scope that cannot land in the assignment window.

### G.2: Specification first

Before you write the fix, write the specification the way this course always does: a failing test that demonstrates the issue.  For documentation work, the specification is the worked example that does not yet exist and the checklist it must satisfy.  Commit it, or record it in its original form in `contribution.md`.  If the project's own test suite has conventions, follow them; reading a mature project's test conventions is part of the learning here.

### G.3: The contribution

Do the work on a fork, and follow the upstream project's `CONTRIBUTING` guidelines to the letter (branch naming, commit style, changelog entries, whatever they ask).  Your pull request must include tests and documentation for what it changes.  Keep the diff as small as the fix allows.  Maintainers review diffs, and a disciplined diff is a professional courtesy they notice.

### G.4: The exchange

Submit the pull request and engage with what comes back: respond to review comments, make requested changes, and record the exchange in `contribution.md`.  A merge is ideal but not required.  Maintainer response times are outside your control, and the graded work is yours, not theirs.  If no maintainer responds within a week of submission, document the attempt and perform a written self-review against the project's own contributing standards: what would a maintainer flag, and why?

### Direction G depth checklist

- The scope was approved by the instructor within 3 days of hand-out, and `contribution.md` records the issue, its functional-paradigm substance, and the minimum viable scope.
- Specification-first evidence exists: the failing test (or documentation checklist) is preserved in its original form, dated before the fix.
- The pull request is public, linked, and includes tests and documentation, following the upstream project's contributing guidelines.
- The maintainer exchange is documented, or, if none occurred within a week, the attempt is documented and a written self-review against the project's standards stands in its place.
- The writeup connects the contribution back to the core: which of Parts 1-2's pure-function and fold disciplines the upstream code exercises, with specific examples from the code you touched.

## Deliverables

Submit a ZIP containing:
- `higher_order.py`: Part 1 (pure functions and combinators)
- `recursive_structures.py`: Part 2 (tree and linked-list operations)
- Your direction's file(s), as named in its section (Direction F submits `logic.pl` and `logic_session.md` instead of Python direction files; Direction G submits `contribution.md` with the public pull request link)
- `test_functional.py`: all tests for the core and your direction, with assertions (Direction F's queries and expected answers live in `logic_session.md`; Direction G's tests live in the upstream pull request, linked from `contribution.md`; the core Part 1/Part 2 tests are still required)
- `test_output.txt`: output of running the test file (all tests passing)
- `readme.md`: approximately one page naming your chosen direction, containing every writeup item on its depth checklist, and closing with two or three sentences connecting the direction back to the core

Ensure reproducibility by listing your Python version (and, for Direction E, your CPU model and core count).

## Reflection Prompts

- Which constraint (no loops, or no assignment) changed your thinking more, and what did it force you to see?
- In Part 2, both `tree_depth` and `tree_flatten` were implemented in terms of `tree_fold`.  What does this tell you about the relationship between fold and other recursive operations?
- Why did you choose the direction you chose, and now that you have finished it, which *other* direction do you most wish you had time for, and what do you suspect it would have taught you?
- Every direction is the same paradigm at a different altitude: closures capture environments, continuations capture control, Church encodings capture data, combinators capture composition, parallelism captures the payoff of purity, logic programming captures relations instead of functions, and an upstream contribution captures the paradigm living in real code.  State, in your own words, the single idea they all share.
- If collaboration with a buddy was permitted, did you work with a buddy on this assignment?  If so, who?  If not, do you certify that this submission represents your own original work?  Please identify any and all portions of your submission that were not originally written by you.
- AI disclosure: list any generative-AI tools you used, for what, and how you verified the results (or state 'none').
- Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all; I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)?
