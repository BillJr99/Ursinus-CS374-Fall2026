title: "CS374: Principles of Programming Languages - Lab: Finite Automata Simulators"

info:
  coursenum: CS374
  purpose: "To build general simulators for deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) that read machine definitions from data files, so the theory beneath every lexer becomes a program you can run, and to trace the subset construction and Thompson's construction once by hand."
  tilt:
    task: "With a partner, build DFA and NFA simulators that read machines from JSON, design one machine of each kind, and trace the subset construction and Thompson's construction by hand on small examples."
    criteria: "I grade correct simulators that handle the stated edge cases, two annotated machine designs, and by-hand construction traces, weighted 10/36/36/18 across the four parts.  The rubric below breaks this down in full."
  points: 15
  goals:
    - To implement general DFA and NFA simulators over machine definitions loaded from JSON
    - To design one DFA and one NFA for specified languages and encode them as data
    - To trace the subset construction and Thompson's construction by hand on small examples
    - To connect automata to the regular expressions and lexer of the surrounding course
  rubric:
    - weight: 10
      description: "Part 0: Before You Start - Regular Expressions and Finite Automata"
      preemerging: Neither the regular expression nor the NFA is attempted
      beginning: A regular expression is written but no NFA is drawn, or the subset construction is not started
      progressing: A regex and a matching NFA are given and the subset construction is begun, but it stalls without the stalling step identified, or no accepted string is named
      proficient: A regular expression for a token class of your choice is given with an NFA that accepts the same language; a small NFA is converted to a DFA by hand over two or three input symbols; one string the DFA accepts is named; and if the state set stopped being obvious, that exact step is marked
    - weight: 36
      description: "DFA Simulation and Design (Goals 1, 2)"
      preemerging: The DFA simulator fails to run, or fails most provided machines because of major structural errors
      beginning: The DFA simulator runs but fails several test cases because of minor issues such as incorrect transition lookups or missing alphabet validation
      progressing: The DFA simulator passes the provided test cases but mishandles edge cases such as the empty string or symbols outside the alphabet, or the designed DFA lacks state annotations
      proficient: A correct DFA simulator passes all provided test machines, handles the empty string and out-of-alphabet symbols deliberately, supports trace mode, and runs the designed DFA with documented state meanings and passing tests
    - weight: 36
      description: "NFA Simulation and Design (Goals 1, 2)"
      preemerging: The NFA simulator is missing, or fails to compute epsilon-closures correctly
      beginning: The NFA simulator runs but produces incorrect results on several machines because of epsilon-closure errors or incorrect powerset tracking
      progressing: The NFA simulator passes the provided test cases but would fail on machines with epsilon cycles, or the designed NFA does not actually use nondeterminism
      proficient: A correct NFA simulator computes epsilon-closures with cycle detection, tracks the set of active states, and passes all provided test machines plus the designed NFA with traced execution paths
    - weight: 18
      description: "By-Hand Constructions (Goals 3, 4)"
      preemerging: Neither construction is attempted, or both traces are fundamentally incorrect
      beginning: One construction is traced but the other is missing, or both contain significant errors
      progressing: Both constructions are traced with minor errors (e.g., a missed epsilon-closure or an unlabeled fragment), or the lexer-connection paragraph is missing
      proficient: The subset-construction table is complete and correct, every Thompson fragment is labeled step by step, and the writeup includes a clear paragraph connecting the simulators to the lexer (which component of the lexer plays the role of your simulators?)

In this lab you build the machines beneath your lexer: general simulators for deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs).  A finite automaton is a small machine that reads a string one symbol at a time, moves between states, and accepts or rejects the string at the end.  A DFA has exactly one next state for each state and symbol.  An NFA may have several next states, or none, and it may move without reading a symbol at all.  Your simulators read each machine's definition from a data file instead of hard-coding it.  You also design one machine of each kind and trace two classic constructions by hand.

The simulators are short programs, and you can check them against the worked traces below.  The constructions are paper exercises, so there is no code to write for those.

**Pair policy.**  You may do this lab in pairs.  Work together at one screen, or split the DFA and NFA halves and review each other's work.  Either way, both of you submit the same ZIP, each naming the other in the writeup, and you both earn the same grade.  You may also work alone if you prefer.  Unlike the programming assignments, no individual-work certification is required here; the reflection asks who did what instead.

## Part 0: Before You Start - Regular Expressions and Finite Automata (10%)

Do this part on paper before you write any simulator code.  You may do it alone even though the rest of this lab is pair work.

A regular expression and a finite automaton are two ways to describe the same set of strings.  Building both for one language of your own is the fastest way to see that they agree.

1.  Write a regular expression for a token class of your choice, such as identifiers or floating-point literals.  Then draw an NFA that accepts the same language.
2.  Convert a small NFA from the reading to a DFA by hand using the subset construction, the algorithm that makes one DFA state for each set of NFA states the machine could be in at once.  Work through two or three input symbols.  Name one string the resulting DFA accepts.

Bring the construction even if it stalled, and mark the subset-construction step where the state set stopped being obvious.  That stall is the useful part: Part 2 of this lab has you automate exactly that step.  Subset construction by hand is tedious exactly once; after that it is a tool you have.

## Getting Started

### Environment and Setup

You need Python 3.10 or newer and only the standard library (the `json` module reads the machine files).  Create the layout from the Deliverables section before you start:

```
simulator.py       # loader, run_dfa, run_nfa, CLI
machines/          # one JSON file per machine
writeup.md         # construction traces and reflection
```

### Your First 15 Minutes

Start with a machine, not with the simulator.  Copy the two-state parity machine JSON from Part 1 into `machines/even_ones.json`.  Then write the smallest possible `run_dfa`:

```python
import json, sys

machine = json.load(open("machines/even_ones.json"))
state = machine["start"]
for symbol in sys.argv[1]:
    state = machine["delta"][state][symbol]
print("accept" if state in machine["accept"] else "reject")
```

Run `python simulator.py 0110` (accept) and `python simulator.py 101` (reject).  Both match the traces shown in Part 1.  Once this ten-line core works, the rest of Part 1 is wrapping it in validation and `--trace`.  The heart of it is already right.

### Suggested Pacing

This lab follows the class material on regular expressions and finite automata; see the course schedule for the assigned and due dates.  One focused session with your partner covers Parts 1 and 2.  The paper constructions fit in a second short sitting:

| Checkpoint | You should have |
|------------|----------------|
| On assignment | Loader and DFA simulator working against the provided machines |
| Midpoint | NFA simulator with epsilon-closure working; both designed machines encoded and tested |
| Due date | Construction traces and writeup assembled; ZIP submitted |

## Part 1: DFA Simulation and Design (36%)

### Machine Format

Every machine is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file with these keys:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| `states` | list of strings | all state names |
| `alphabet` | list of strings | all input symbols (each a single character) |
| `start` | string | the initial state |
| `accept` | list of strings | the accepting states |
| `delta` | object | transition function |

For a DFA, `delta` is a nested object: `delta[state][symbol]` gives the next state.  Every (state, symbol) pair over the alphabet must appear.

Here is the two-state parity machine for "even number of 1s":

```json
{
  "states": ["even", "odd"],
  "alphabet": ["0", "1"],
  "start": "even",
  "accept": ["even"],
  "delta": {
    "even": {"0": "even", "1": "odd"},
    "odd":  {"0": "odd",  "1": "even"}
  }
}
```

Trace on `"0110"`: even -> even -> odd -> even -> even.  Accepts. yes  
Trace on `"101"`: even -> odd -> even -> odd.  Rejects. yes

### Step 1a: Loader and DFA Simulator

Write `load_machine(path)`.  It reads a JSON file and checks that the start state, the accept states, and every transition refer only to declared states and alphabet symbols.  Collect all validation errors and raise a single `MachineError` that lists them.

Then implement `run_dfa(machine, s) -> bool` with these rules:
- Any symbol in `s` that is not in the machine's alphabet is an immediate reject.  Print a reason; do not crash.
- The empty string `""` is valid input.  It tests whether the start state is an accept state.
- With the `--trace` flag, print the current state after each symbol.

Test against the parity machine above (provided) with at least four accepted strings and four rejected strings.

### Step 1b: One DFA Design

Design the DFA below, encode it as JSON, and annotate each state with one sentence saying what it "remembers":

**DFA, Ends in ab:** strings over `{a, b}` that end with the suffix `ab`.  
Worked example: `"aab"` -> accept; `"ba"` -> reject; `"ab"` -> accept; `""` -> reject.  
Hint: you need at least three states: track what suffix of `ab` has been seen most recently.

Test with at least four accepted and four rejected strings.

---

## Part 2: NFA Simulation and Design (36%)

### NFA Machine Format

For an NFA, `delta` maps `"state,symbol"` string keys to lists of states.  The special symbol `"eps"` marks an epsilon (ε) transition, a move the machine may take without reading any input.  A state may have zero or more targets for any symbol.

Example fragment:

```json
"delta": {
  "q0,a": ["q0", "q1"],
  "q0,eps": ["q2"],
  "q1,b": ["q2"]
}
```

### Step 2a: Epsilon-Closure and NFA Simulator

Implement `eps_closure(machine, states) -> frozenset`.  The epsilon-closure of a set of states is every state you can reach from that set by following only `"eps"` transitions, including the starting states themselves.  It is a small graph reachability computation:

1.  Start with the given set of states.
2.  Follow every `"eps"` transition out of the set and add the targets.
3.  Repeat until no new state appears.

Handle cycles.  A state may epsilon-transition back to itself or to a predecessor, and your loop must still stop.

Example: If `q0 -ε-> q1`, `q1 -ε-> q2`, and `q2 -ε-> q0`, then `eps_closure(m, {"q0"}) = {"q0", "q1", "q2"}`.

Then implement `run_nfa(machine, s) -> bool`:
1.  Compute the epsilon-closure of `{start}` as the initial set of active states.
2.  For each symbol in `s`, take the union of all `delta["state,symbol"]` lists over all active states, then take the epsilon-closure of that union.
3.  Accept if the final active set shares at least one state with the accept set.

### Step 2b: One NFA Design

Design the NFA below, encode it as JSON, and test it with at least four accepted and four rejected strings:

**NFA, Contains aa:** strings over `{a, b}` containing the substring `aa` somewhere.  
Worked example: `"baaab"` -> accept; `"ababab"` -> reject.  
Hint: nondeterministically guess where `aa` occurs: your design should really use nondeterminism, not be a DFA in disguise.

## Part 3: By-Hand Constructions (18%)

These are paper exercises in your writeup, with no code.  The class sessions covered both algorithms.  Here you trace each once on a small example, so you have run by hand what lexer-generator tools automate.

### Step 3a: Subset Construction Trace

Apply the subset construction to your Contains aa NFA from Part 2 to produce an equivalent DFA.  Draw the construction table:

| Powerset State | on `a` | on `b` | Accepting? |
|----------------|--------|--------|------------|
| {q0} | ... | ... | No/Yes |
| ... | | | |

1.  Start with `eps_closure({start})` as the first powerset state.
2.  For each powerset state you have not yet processed, compute its transitions on each symbol and epsilon-close the results.  Each result is a new row if you have not seen it before.
3.  Mark a powerset state as accepting if it contains any NFA accept state.
4.  Continue until every powerset state has been processed.

Record how many DFA states result.

### Step 3b: Thompson's Construction Trace

Apply Thompson's construction to the regular expression `a(b|c)*`.  Show each sub-expression and its fragment, labeling every state and every ε-transition:
1.  Fragment for `a`.
2.  Fragments for `b` and `c`.
3.  Fragment for `b|c` (union).
4.  Fragment for `(b|c)*` (Kleene star).
5.  Concatenation: `a` then `(b|c)*`.

For reference, the fragment rules are:
- A single character: a start state and an accept state joined by one transition labeled with that character.
- Concatenation of A then B: connect A's accept to B's start with ε.
- Union of A and B: add a new start with ε to both fragments' starts, and ε from both accepts to a new shared accept.
- Kleene star of A: add a new start with ε to A's start and to a new accept, plus ε from A's accept back to A's start and on to the new accept.

## Reflection Prompts

- Contrast designing the NFA with tracing its equivalent DFA via subset construction: where did the complexity move?
- Your simulators treat machines as data (loaded from JSON).  Name one benefit this brought during testing that hard-coded machines would have denied you.
- If you worked in a pair, who did what, and name one thing your partner caught that you would have missed.  If you worked alone, note that instead.
- AI disclosure: list any generative-AI tools you used, for what, and how you verified the results (or state 'none').
- Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this lab (I will not judge you for this at all; I am simply using it to gauge if the labs are too easy or hard)?
