This assignment turns the class tokenizer into a **component**: the first permanent piece of your language pipeline.  A component is a module that other code imports and uses without changing it.  The Parser assignment imports your Lexer unchanged, and your team project ships it.  Every design decision you make here carries forward, so document your interface carefully.  Build in the scaffolded steps below, and test after each step before you move on.

---

## Part 0: Before You Start (Tokens and Scanning, 10 points)

Do this part first, before you write any lexer code.  It takes about twenty minutes on paper.

A scanner (the program that splits source text into tokens) is easy to write for input that behaves and interesting to write for input that does not.  The awkward cases below are the ones this assignment turns on, so form an opinion about them before you implement anything.

1.  Hand-tokenize the line `x = 12 + foo(3)` into a token stream.  Give each token a type and a value.  Then predict what your scanner should do with `12foo`, and with `= =` versus `==`.
2.  Write the regular expressions your lexer would use for three token classes.  Identify one pair whose patterns overlap.  Which rule wins, and why does order matter?

Bring your answer for `12foo`: one token, two tokens, or an error.  Bring it even if you are not confident.  Disagreement about these cases is the point, and Part 1's ordered `TOKEN_SPEC` is where your answer becomes a design decision you have to live with.

---

## Choose Your Direction

This is one assignment with one deliverable and one rubric.  You build it in one of two directions:

- **Hand-rolled lexer (the core direction).**  Build the Lexer yourself in Python on top of the `re` module, following Parts 1-3 below.  Most students take this direction, and the step-by-step scaffolding assumes it.
- **Generator-toolchain lexer (Flex or PLY).**  Build the same component with a lexer generator: Flex (for C) or PLY (for Python).  These tools produce the scanners inside major compilers.  This direction replaces the vehicle of Parts 1 and 2 (the `TOKEN_SPEC` list, the `tokenize` generator, and the hand-written class internals) with a generator specification.  The interface contract, Part 3's error, position, and test requirements, the deliverable structure, and the rubric all apply the same way.  See **[The Generator-Toolchain Direction](#the-generator-toolchain-direction-flex-or-ply)** below for the full mapping.

In either direction you submit a token specification, a working lexer component behind the `peek`/`advance`/`expect` contract, and positioned errors with a full test suite.  Both directions are graded on the same 30/40/30 rubric.

---

## Getting Started

### Environment and Setup

You need Python 3.10 or newer (`python --version`; record the version in your readme) and only the standard library (`re`, `json`, `dataclasses`).  This assignment grows the class tokenizer, or the `finditer` mini lexer you built in the Regex assignment, into a component.  Start from whichever of those you trust more.  Create the deliverable files up front:

```
lexer.py             # the Lexer module
token_spec.json      # default token specification (Step 2d)
token_spec_alt.json  # alternate dialect (Step 2d)
test_lexer.py        # the test suite
```

### Your First 30 Minutes

1.  Define the `Token` dataclass from Step 1b.
2.  Write a `TOKEN_SPEC` with just six rules: `WHITESPACE`, `LET`, `IDENT`, `EQ`, `INT`, `SEMICOLON`.
3.  Write the `tokenize` generator from Step 1c and run it on the worked example:

```python
for tok in tokenize("let x = 42;"):
    print(tok)
```

Compare your output against the six-token listing in Step 1c, including line and column numbers.  Then feed it `lets x = 42;` and confirm that `lets` comes out as a single `IDENT`.  If it comes out as `LET` + `IDENT("s")`, your keyword pattern is missing its boundary check.  It is far better to learn that now with six rules than later with twenty-nine.

### Suggested Pacing

See the course schedule for the assigned and due dates.  Your starting point is the mini lexer you built in the **Regex Workshop lab** and grew in the Regex assignment.  This assignment turns it into a permanent pipeline component.  The Finite Automata Simulators lab runs alongside the start of this window.  It is short by design, so plan its two to three hours into your week:

| Checkpoint | You should have |
|------------|----------------|
| On assignment | `Token` dataclass and a six-rule `tokenize` generator working (grown from your mini lexer) |
| Checkpoint 1 | Parts 1-2a: full `TOKEN_SPEC` passing all maximal-munch cases, and the core `Lexer` class with `peek`/`advance`/`expect` working |
| Checkpoint 2 | Parts 2b-2c: string escapes and JSON configuration (both dialects) |
| Due date | Part 3 error modes with precise positions and the full test suite complete; readme written; ZIP assembled and submitted |

---

## Part 1: Token Specification (27 points)

### Why Order Matters

A lexer built on regular expressions applies its rules in order and uses *maximal munch*: at each position, it matches the longest string it can.  Two rules produce bugs if you order them wrong:

- If `IDENT` appears before `IF`, then `if` will be tokenized as an identifier named `"if"`.
- If `LT` (`<`) appears before `LE` (`<=`), then `<=` will be tokenized as `LT` followed by `EQ`.

The correct ordering is keywords before identifiers, and longer operators before their prefixes.

### Step 1a: Define the TOKEN_SPEC

Define a `TOKEN_SPEC` list of `(token_name, regex_pattern)` pairs.  It must cover, at minimum, every token type in the table below.  Write every pattern as a raw string (`r"..."`).

| Token Name | Example Lexemes | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| `COMMENT` | `# this is a comment` | Match to end of line; to be skipped |
| `WHITESPACE` | ` `, `\t`, `\n` | Skip; track newlines for line counting |
| `STRING` | `"hello"`, `"a\nb"` | Double-quoted; see Part 3 for escapes |
| `FLOAT` | `3.14`, `-0.5` | Must appear before INT |
| `INT` | `42`, `0` | Non-negative; sign handled by unary minus |
| `IF` | `if` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `ELSE` | `else` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `WHILE` | `while` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `LET` | `let` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `PRINT` | `print` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `TRUE` | `true` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `FALSE` | `false` | Must appear before IDENT |
| `AND` | `and` | Must appear before IDENT; used by the Parser's `and_expr` |
| `OR` | `or` | Must appear before IDENT; used by the Parser's `or_expr` |
| `NOT` | `not` | Must appear before IDENT; used by the Parser's `not_expr` |
| `FUN` | `fun` | Must appear before IDENT; used by function definitions |
| `IDENT` | `foo`, `my_var`, `x1` | Letter or underscore, then letters/digits/underscores |
| `LE` | `<=` | Must appear before LT |
| `GE` | `>=` | Must appear before GT |
| `EQEQ` | `==` | Must appear before EQ |
| `NEQ` | `!=` | Must appear before BANG |
| `BANG` | `!` | Logical negation; must appear after NEQ |
| `ARROW` | `->` | Return-type annotation; must appear before MINUS |
| `EQ` | `=` | Assignment |
| `LT` | `<` | |
| `GT` | `>` | |
| `PLUS` | `+` | |
| `MINUS` | `-` | |
| `STAR` | `*` | |
| `SLASH` | `/` | |
| `LPAREN` | `(` | |
| `RPAREN` | `)` | |
| `LBRACE` | `{` | |
| `RBRACE` | `}` | |
| `SEMICOLON` | `;` | |
| `COLON` | `:` | Type annotations, e.g. `let x: Num = 42;` |
| `COMMA` | `,` | Parameter and argument lists |

**Maximal-munch test cases you must pass:** `iffy` -> `IDENT("iffy")` (not `IF` + `IDENT("ffy")`); `<=` -> `LE` (not `LT` + `EQ`); `==` -> `EQEQ` (not two `EQ`s); `whiles` -> `IDENT("whiles")`; `notable` -> `IDENT("notable")` (not `NOT` + `IDENT("able")`); `->` -> `ARROW` (not `MINUS` + `GT`); `!=` -> `NEQ` (not `BANG` + `EQ`).

### Step 1b: Token Dataclass

Define a `Token` dataclass (or namedtuple) with four fields: `type` (string), `value` (string, the raw lexeme), `line` (int), and `col` (int).  The EOF token has type `"EOF"`, value `""`, and the line and column of the last character consumed.

### Step 1c: Baseline Tokenize Generator

Write a `tokenize(source: str) -> Iterator[Token]` generator.  At the current position, it tries the `TOKEN_SPEC` rules with `re.match`, skips WHITESPACE and COMMENT tokens, and advances the position by the match length.  Verify it against the provided test programs before you wrap it in a class.

**Worked example**, source `"let x = 42;"`:

```
Token(LET,       "let", line=1, col=1)
Token(IDENT,     "x",   line=1, col=5)
Token(EQ,        "=",   line=1, col=7)
Token(INT,       "42",  line=1, col=9)
Token(SEMICOLON, ";",   line=1, col=11)
Token(EOF,       "",    line=1, col=12)
```

### Step 1d: Lexing Theory Questions (in your readme)

Answer three written questions from the Tokens and Scanning session.  They are graded within Part 1's rubric row.

1.  **Maximal munch, precisely.**  Your spec tokenizes `<==` as `LE` then `EQ`, not `LT` then `EQEQ`, and not three single-character tokens.  State the two rules (longest match, then rule order) that force this outcome.  Then give one input where the two rules would *disagree* about the result if you applied them in the other priority.
2.  **Why keywords aren't the lexer's problem twice.**  `iffy` must lex as one `IDENT`, never `IF` + `IDENT("fy")`.  Explain the two different mechanisms that can enforce this: rule ordering with boundary-aware patterns, versus lexing as an identifier and then reclassifying against a keyword table.  Name one cost of each.
3.  **The division of labor.**  `let 42 = x;` lexes without a single error.  In one sentence per stage, state why the lexer *must* accept it and which later pipeline stage rejects it.  Then say what this tells you about what a token stream does and does not promise.

---

## Part 2: Lexer Class Implementation (36 points)

### The Interface Contract

The parser will use exactly three methods:

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `peek() -> Token` | Return the next token *without consuming it*. Idempotent: calling it ten times in a row must return the same token. |
| `advance() -> Token` | Consume and return the next token. After calling advance, the next peek/advance returns the token after the one just returned. |
| `expect(token_type: str) -> Token` | If the next token matches `token_type`, consume and return it. Otherwise raise `LexError` with the expected type, found type, and position. |

At end of input, both `peek` and `advance` return the EOF token repeatedly.  They never raise `StopIteration` or return `None`.

### Step 2a: Implement the Lexer Class

```python
class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, source: str, config_path: str = None):
        ...  # load config if provided, build token stream, initialize lookahead buffer

    def peek(self) -> Token: ...
    def advance(self) -> Token: ...
    def expect(self, token_type: str) -> Token: ...
```

Use an internal buffer that holds one token (the lookahead).  When the buffer is empty, pull the next token from your generator and fill it.  `peek` returns the buffer contents without clearing the buffer.  `advance` returns the buffer contents and clears the buffer.

### Step 2b: Verify Two Consumption Patterns

Show that a peek-driven loop and an advance-driven loop produce identical token streams:

```python
# Pattern A: peek-driven
tokens_a = []
while lexer_a.peek().type != "EOF":
    tokens_a.append(lexer_a.advance())

# Pattern B: advance-driven
tokens_b = []
tok = lexer_b.advance()
while tok.type != "EOF":
    tokens_b.append(tok)
    tok = lexer_b.advance()

assert tokens_a == tokens_b, "Consumption patterns disagree!"
```

### Step 2c: String Literals with Escapes

Extend the STRING pattern (or handle strings as a special case) to support these escape sequences:

| Escape sequence | Decoded value |
|----------------|--------------|
| `\"` | double-quote character |
| `\\` | backslash |
| `\n` | newline (ASCII 10) |
| `\t` | tab (ASCII 9) |

Store both the raw lexeme (e.g., `"a\nb"` with a backslash-n) and the decoded value (with a real newline) in the Token.  An unterminated string is one that reaches end-of-line or end-of-file without a closing `"`.  It must raise a `LexError` that points at the *opening* quote's position, not at the end of input.

**Worked example:**

```
source: "hello\nworld"
raw lexeme:    "hello\nworld"   (14 chars including quotes)
decoded value: hello           (with a real newline between)
               world
```

### Step 2d: JSON Configuration

Move TOKEN_SPEC to a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "comment_char": "#",
  "tokens": [
    ["COMMENT",    "#[^\n]*"],
    ["WHITESPACE", "[ \t\n]+"],
    ["STRING",     "\"(?:[^\"\\\\]|\\\\.)*\""],
    ...
  ]
}
```

Load and validate the config when `Lexer.__init__` runs.  Every pattern must compile: catch `re.error` and raise `LexError` with the offending pattern.  Then show that the spec is configurable.  Write a second JSON spec in which the comment character is `//` and the assignment operator is `:=`, and show the same `Lexer` class tokenizing a short program in that dialect.

---

## Part 3: Error Handling, Positions, and Test Suite (27 points)

### Step 3a: Precise Error Positions

Every `LexError` must include:
- The line number (1-indexed) of the offending character
- The column number (1-indexed) of the offending character
- The offending text itself (the unrecognized character or the unterminated string lexeme)

Example message format: `LexError at line 3, col 7: unexpected character '@'`

Track the line number by counting the `\n` characters you consume.  Track the column by resetting it to 1 after each newline.

### Step 3b: Two Error Modes

Implement two modes, chosen at construction time with `error_mode="fail_fast"` (the default) or `error_mode="collect_all"`:

- **fail_fast**: raise `LexError` on the first unrecognized character.
- **collect_all**: skip each unrecognized character and record its error, finish tokenizing, then raise a single `LexErrorList` that holds all the errors.  The programmer sees every mistake in one pass instead of fixing them one at a time.

### Step 3c: Test Suite

Build `test_lexer.py` with at least the test cases below.  Each test must assert the token types in order and, for selected tokens, the value, line, and col.

**Token type coverage (one test per type):**
- INT, FLOAT, STRING (with escape), IDENT, IF, ELSE, WHILE, LET, PRINT, TRUE, FALSE
- All operators: PLUS, MINUS, STAR, SLASH, EQ, EQEQ, NEQ, LT, LE, GT, GE, LPAREN, RPAREN, LBRACE, RBRACE, SEMICOLON

**Maximal-munch cases:**
- `iffy` -> single IDENT, not IF + IDENT
- `whiles` -> single IDENT
- `<=` -> LE, not LT + EQ
- `==` -> EQEQ, not EQ + EQ
- `!=` -> NEQ, not two tokens

**String escape cases:**
- `"no escapes"` -> value equals `no escapes`
- `"tab\there"` -> value contains a real tab
- `"line\nbreak"` -> value contains a real newline
- `"quote\"end"` -> value contains a double-quote

**Deliberate error programs (five required):**
1.  A program with `@`: expect `LexError at line 1, col ...`
2.  An unterminated string `"hello`: expect `LexError` at the opening quote
3.  A program with `$` in the middle: check position is mid-program, not line 1
4.  A collect-all run with two errors: verify both are reported
5.  A program with a valid token immediately after an error: verify recovery in collect-all mode

---

## The Generator-Toolchain Direction (Flex or PLY)

In this direction, you build the same component with a lexer generator instead of a hand-rolled `re` loop.  The generator does the maximal-munch machinery for you.  Your job shifts to three things: write the rule specification correctly, wrap the generated scanner behind the interface contract, and prove the same properties with the same tests.  The three parts above map onto this direction as follows.

### Part 1 equivalent: the rule specification

Write a Flex `.l` file (or a PLY `tokens`/`t_*` module) that covers the full token table from Step 1a.  The ordering discipline is the same.  Generators resolve ties by rule order (Flex) or by function definition order and pattern length (PLY), so the same bugs await you if keywords trail `IDENT` or `<` precedes `<=`.  Your specification must handle:

- **Numeric literals**: integers and floats (`[0-9]+\.[0-9]*` and `[0-9]*\.[0-9]+`), with FLOAT tried before INT.
- **String literals** in double quotes with `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t` escape sequences, decoded at scan time (in Flex, store the decoded string via `strdup`; in PLY, set `t.value` to the decoded text while keeping the raw lexeme available).
- **Identifiers vs. keywords**: match `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` and check a keyword table, returning the keyword's own token type for `if`, `else`, `while`, `let`, `print`, `true`, `false`.  This is the generator idiom for "keywords before IDENT."  Your readme must explain why the keyword-table approach and the rule-ordering approach are equivalent.
- **Multi-character operators**: `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` as single tokens, listed so they win over their single-character prefixes.
- **Comments and whitespace**: `#` to end of line, skipped; whitespace skipped with newlines counted (`%option yylineno` in Flex; track `t.lexer.lineno` in PLY).

The pass criteria are the same maximal-munch cases from Step 1a: `iffy` -> `IDENT`, `whiles` -> `IDENT`, `<=` -> `LE`, `==` -> `EQEQ`.

### Part 2 equivalent: the component wrapper

The generated scanner hands you a next-token function: `yylex()` in Flex, `lexer.token()` in PLY.  Your deliverable is still a component with the interface contract.  Wrap the generated scanner in a `Lexer` class (PLY) or a small driver module (Flex) that exposes `peek`, `advance`, and `expect` with exactly the behaviors in the table above: an idempotent `peek`, EOF tokens forever at end of input, and a located `LexError` from `expect` on mismatch.  Show the same two consumption patterns from Step 2b agreeing.  In place of Step 2d's JSON configuration, provide a second rule specification that implements the alternate dialect (`//` comments, `:=` assignment), and show the same wrapper driving both.  This meets the configurability requirement using the tools' own configuration medium.

### Part 3 applies unchanged

This direction requires precise line and column positions on every error, the fail-fast and collect-all modes, and the full test suite of Step 3c (token type coverage, maximal-munch cases, string escapes, and the five deliberate error programs), exactly as written.  (In Flex, collect-all means your error rule records the offense and continues scanning rather than exiting.)

### Where the toolchain goes next

Flex is one half of a pair.  Its companion parser generator, Bison (or PLY's `yacc` module), turns a context-free grammar with precedence declarations into an LALR parser.  That half is deliberately out of scope here.  It is the natural continuation of this direction, and the Parser assignment offers a matching generator-toolchain direction where your Flex/PLY scanner feeds a Bison/PLY grammar.  Choosing the generator direction now sets you up well for that one, but the two choices are independent: you choose a direction assignment by assignment.

## Deliverables

Submit a ZIP containing:
- `lexer.py`: the Lexer module (importable with no side effects)
- `token_spec.json`: the default token specification
- `token_spec_alt.json`: the alternate dialect specification (`//` comments, `:=` assignment)
- `test_lexer.py`: the test suite with documented test cases
- `test_output.txt`: the output of running `python test_lexer.py` (all tests passing)
- `readme.md`: approximately one page documenting the Lexer interface for the parser author (future you), including the TOKEN_SPEC ordering rationale and the two error modes

List your Python version (`python --version`) so that I can reproduce your results.

**Generator-toolchain direction:** the deliverable structure is identical with the vehicle swapped.  Submit the `.l` file (plus a `Makefile` that builds the scanner from scratch) or the PLY lexer module in place of the hand-rolled internals; the default and alternate-dialect rule specifications in place of the two JSON files; the wrapper exposing `peek`/`advance`/`expect`; the same test suite and `test_output.txt`; and a readme that also records your toolchain versions (`flex --version`, or your PLY version) and explains the keyword-table idiom.

## Reflection Prompts

- Which scanning rule (maximal munch or priority) caused you a real bug, and how did your tests catch it?
- Which direction did you choose, and what did that choice make easier or harder than you expected?  If you took the generator toolchain: what did Flex or PLY do for you that you would otherwise have written by hand, and what did it hide that you had to recover?
- What about your lexer would you change if your language used significant indentation like Python?
- The `expect` method was designed for the parser's benefit.  Explain why the parser needs `expect` rather than just calling `advance` and checking the type afterward.
- If collaboration with a buddy was permitted, did you work with a buddy on this assignment?  If so, who?  If not, do you certify that this submission represents your own original work?  Please identify any and all portions of your submission that were not originally written by you.
- AI disclosure: list any generative-AI tools you used, for what, and how you verified the results (or state 'none').
- Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all; I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)?
