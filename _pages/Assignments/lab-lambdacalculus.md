  rubric:
    - weight: 10
      description: "Part 0: Before You Start - Beta Reduction and Church Encodings"
      preemerging: No reductions are attempted
      beginning: A reduction is attempted but the steps are not shown individually
      progressing: Both reductions are carried out step by step, but the non-terminating case is not explained, or the SUCC ZERO verification is incomplete
      proficient: (lambda x. lambda y. x) a b is beta-reduced to normal form with every step written out; the self-application case is reduced far enough to show why it never terminates, and that is explained; SUCC ZERO is verified by reduction to behave like ONE; and the step you were least confident was legal is marked
    - weight: 50
      description: "Beta Reduction (Goal 1)"
      preemerging: Reductions are missing or skip directly to claimed answers with no steps
      beginning: Simple reductions are correct but the capture-avoidance case substitutes blindly, capturing the free variable
      progressing: All reductions are correct including the alpha-renaming, but redexes are not marked or one sequence skips steps
      proficient: Every reduction is shown one beta-step at a time with the redex underlined or bracketed at each step, the capture case is handled by explicit alpha-renaming with a sentence explaining why, and the normal-order vs. applicative-order question is answered with the divergence example
    - weight: 40
      description: "Church Encodings (Goals 2, 3)"
      preemerging: Encodings are stated but never verified by reduction
      beginning: The boolean verifications are shown but the numeral ones are missing or incorrect
      progressing: All verifications are shown with one reduction error, or the connection question is unanswered
      proficient: TRUE/FALSE/AND and successor-of-one are all verified by complete reduction sequences, and the closing question connects Church encoding to a concrete higher-order-function idiom from the Functional Programming sessions

This **lab** is entirely on paper.  You and a partner evaluate lambda calculus expressions by hand, the way the Lambda Calculus class sessions do on the board.  No later assignment imports this lab, so it stands alone, but it prepares you for two things.  The first is the Functional Programming assignment's Direction C, Church encodings in code, where the reductions you write here become the test cases your reducer has to reproduce.  The second is the closures material, where "a function that captures a variable" stops being mysterious once you have alpha-renamed by hand.  Give yourself enough time to work the reductions slowly.  Rushing them defeats the purpose.

**Pair policy.**  You may do this lab in pairs.  Reduce independently, then reconcile line by line; the disagreements are where the learning is.  Hand in one document between you, each naming the other, and you both receive the same grade.  You may also do this alone.

Five terms come up throughout, so here they are in one place:

- A *redex* is a subterm ready to reduce: a lambda applied to an argument, such as `(λx. x) y`.
- *Beta reduction* contracts a redex by substituting the argument for the bound variable in the body.  One contraction is one beta-step.
- A term is in *normal form* when it contains no redexes.
- *Capture* happens when a free variable in the argument becomes bound by accident after substitution.
- *Alpha-renaming* changes a bound variable's name (with all its uses) to avoid capture.  It does not change the term's meaning.

## Part 0: Before You Start - Beta Reduction and Church Encodings (10%)

Do this part first, before the rest of the lab.  Use pencil and paper, and write every step down.

Beta reduction is a rewriting rule.  You learn it by applying it slowly and recording each step.  Two reductions will do: one that reaches a normal form, and one that never will.  The second is why the lambda calculus is worth a unit of this course.

1.  Beta-reduce `(λx. λy. x) a b` to normal form, showing each step.  Then try `(λx. x x)(λx. x x)` and explain what happens.
2.  Using the Church encodings from the reading, verify by reduction that `SUCC ZERO` behaves like `ONE`.

Bring the reduction step you were least confident was legal.  Those are the steps we work through at the board, and capture-avoiding substitution (Part 1) is usually the reason one felt wrong.

## Part 1: Beta Reduction (50%)

In `reductions.md`, reduce each expression below to normal form.  Write one beta-step per line, and mark the redex you contract at each step by underlining or bracketing it.  Before each step, ask whether the substitution would capture a free variable; if it would, alpha-rename first.

1. `(λx. x) y`
2. `(λx. λy. x) a b`
3. `(λf. λx. f (f x)) (λz. z + 1) 0`: treat `+` and numerals as constants.
4.  **The capture case:** `(λx. λy. x) y`: blind substitution captures the free `y`; alpha-rename first and add one sentence explaining what would have gone wrong without it.
5. `(λx. x x) (λx. x x)`: reduce three steps, then state what this term tells you about termination.  Then answer: given `(λx. z) ((λx. x x) (λx. x x))`, which evaluation order (normal or applicative) terminates, and what does that imply about lazy evaluation?

For item 5, normal order reduces the leftmost outermost redex first, and applicative order reduces arguments before applying the function.  Remember from this part: every reduction is a sequence of single steps, each with its redex marked, and the capture case is the one place you must rename before you substitute.

## Part 2: Church Encodings (40%)

A Church encoding represents a value such as a boolean or a number as a lambda term, so that the calculus needs no built-in data at all.  Using `TRUE = λt. λf. t`, `FALSE = λt. λf. f`, `AND = λp. λq. p q p`, and numerals `ZERO = λf. λx. x`, `ONE = λf. λx. f x`, `SUCC = λn. λf. λx. f (n f x)`:

1.  Verify `AND TRUE FALSE` reduces to `FALSE`, showing every step.
2.  Verify `AND TRUE TRUE` reduces to `TRUE`.
3.  Verify `SUCC ONE` reduces to a term alpha-equivalent to `TWO = λf. λx. f (f x)`.
4.  Close with a short answer: a Church numeral *is* a higher-order function, "apply `f`, `n` times."  Name the Python or Scheme idiom from the Functional Programming sessions that does exactly this, and one place your team language or interpreter could use the same trick.

Two terms are alpha-equivalent when they differ only in the names of bound variables, so item 3 succeeds when your result matches `TWO` after renaming.  Remember from this part: a verification is a complete reduction sequence that ends at the expected term, not a claim that it would.

## Deliverables

Submit `reductions.md` (or a scanned/photographed handwritten equivalent, legible) containing both parts, with both partners named at the top.

## Grading Breakdown

This lab is worth 15 points, as the course schedule states.  Each part's weight below is a percentage of those 15 points, and the rubric rows use the same percentages.

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Part 0: Beta Reduction and Church Encodings | 10% |
| Part 1: Beta Reduction | 50% |
| Part 2: Church Encodings | 40% |
| **Total** | **100% (15 points)** |

## Reflection Prompts

- Which reduction did you and your partner disagree on, and what settled it?
- If you worked in a pair, who did what.  If you worked alone, note that instead.
- AI disclosure: list any generative-AI tools you used, for what, and how you verified the results (or state 'none').
- Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this lab (I will not judge you for this at all; I am simply using it to gauge if the labs are too easy or hard)?
